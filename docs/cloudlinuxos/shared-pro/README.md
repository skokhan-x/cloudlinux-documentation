# CloudLinux OS Pro Components

## Introduction

CloudLinux OS Shared Hosting Pro was developed with shared hosting in mind. It’s a state-of-the-art operating system that gives shared hosting providers what they need: advanced automation, deep-look performance analytics, and centralized monitoring tools.

It includes additional tools to expand the functionality.

To activate the CloudLinux OS Shared Pro you have to purchase a Shared Pro license first, or upgrade the existing one from the [cln.cloudlinux.com](https://cln.cloudlinux.com) then activate a license on a server using the [same instructions](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinuxos/cloudlinux_installation/#license-activation) just with a new key.

:::tip Info
Apart from the functionality described in this documentation section, the Shared Pro edition includes all the [CloudLinux Shared OS features](/cloudlinuxos/cloudlinux_os_components/#cloudlinux-os-components).
:::

## AccelerateWP

### Getting started

AccelerateWP carries a suite of optimization features that can be enabled and automatically configured for the end user's site.

There are AccelerateWP, AccelerateWP Premium and AccelerateWP CDN feature suites.

AccelerateWP suite is always enabled when AccelerateWP is turned on. Choose whether you want to offer AccelerateWP Premium 
offer AccelerateWP Premium or CDN (Content Delivery Network) for your users (by opting in) and click "Turn on" to start exploring AccelerateWP. 

:::tip Note
AccelerateWP Free suite is enabled by default on all new servers. Proceed to [suites configuration](/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/#suites-usage-statistics) if your server has AccelerateWP already turned on.
:::

##### Activate AccelerateWP for a single server

![WHM CloudLinux Manager AccelerateWP tab: Premium Features checked, upgrade URL field, CDN section](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPAdminPaidPremium.webp)



:::tip Note
By default, AccelerateWP Premium suite includes Object Cache (which is not billable per user). If the option to allow billable optimization features is selected in CLN, the additional premium features will be included in the suite.
:::



![AccelerateWP settings: Premium for Object Caching (Redis), upgrade URL field, Turn on button](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPAdminNonPaidPremium.webp)


Enable AccelerateWP Free for all users on the server via [CLI](#enable-acceleratewp-free)

Enable AccelerateWP Premium for all users on the server via [CLI](#enable-acceleratewp-premium)

Once the AccelerateWP suite is enabled by an administrator,
end-users will see an AccelerateWP tab in their control panel interface and be able to activate the optimization feature.

When AccelerateWP CDN suite is enabled by the administrator, end-users will get 1 GB of CDN traffic and be able to activate
the feature to use until the limit is reached. Once the 1GB limit is reached - the end-user will be suggested to extend the CDN limit by
purchasing a CDN plan using [WHMCS or 3'd party billing](#whmcs-billing).

When the AccelerateWP Premium suite is enabled by the administrator, 
end-users will see the free Object Caching feature in their interface.
If current [CloudLinux license](/cln/dashboard/#acceleratewp-features-management-for-regular-customers) gives access to billable features - end-users will see Image Optimization and Critical CSS features as well.
but cannot activate the feature unless they purchase the feature using [WHMCS or 3'd party billing](#whmcs-billing).

##### Activate AccelerateWP Free on all servers via Centralized Monitoring

It is possible to activate AccelerateWP Free on all compatible servers via the [Centralized Monitoring UI](https://cm.cloudlinux.com) 
or via the [CLN UI](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/cloudlinux/centralized-monitoring). 
Once Activate button is clicked - AccelerateWP Free will be set up automatically on all compatible servers within couple of minutes.

![CLN C-Monitoring: Centralized Monitoring and AccelerateWP cards each with orange ACTIVATE](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/CMInstallationProd.webp)

##### Activate AccelerateWP Premium on all servers via Centralized Monitoring

Starting from ```lve-utils-6.5.11-1``` it is possible to activate AccelerateWP Premium via Centralized Monitoring as well.

![Select features modal: Premium Features checked, upgrade URL required, Cancel and ACTIVATE](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/CMInstallationPremium.webp)

AccelerateWP Premium will be activated on all compatible servers once activation button is clicked and upgrade url is provided.
Before using AccelerateWP Premium features - all end-users will be requested to upgrade to Premium plan using provided upgrade url.

:::tip Note
The list of AccelerateWP Premium features depends on current CloudLinux License, if it does not provide access to
billable features (Image Optimization, Critical CSS) - only Object Cache will be available
:::


##### AccelerateWP suite
This is a basic suite which includes [AccelerateWP base feature](https://user-docs.cloudlinux.com/wpos-plugin/#acceleratewp-feature-wordpress-optimization-plugin): 
a WordPress optimization plugin that provides full page caching, GZIP compression and some other useful optimizations.

**AccelerateWP suite limitations**
* the website must be on an Apache or LiteSpeed web server;
* the website must be on a server with CloudLinuxOS Shared Pro, Solo, or Admin license
* the website must use PHP version 7.3 or higher.
* the WordPress version must be 5.8 and higher.
* no other WordPress Caching plugins must be installed.
* WordPress should not be running in Multisite mode.

##### AccelerateWP Premium suite

Starting from ```accelerate-wp-1.9-18``` - AccelerateWP Premium suite includes both free and billable optimization features. 
The available features depend on the CloudLinux license installed on the server.

For more information on how to set up a CloudLinux license with AccelerateWP Premium billable features, see
[Setup CloudLinux license with AccelerateWP Premium billable features](/cln/dashboard/#acceleratewp-features-management-for-regular-customers)

**Free features**
* Object Caching;

**Billable features**
* Image Optimization;
* Critical CSS;

Once a server is licensed with CloudLinux and has paid features enabled, 
both free and billable features become available. 
If the license does not include paid features, only free features will be accessible.

[Object Caching feature](/user-docs/user-docs-shared-pro-cloudlinux/#acceleratewp-premium-object-caching-feature).

The Object Caching mechanism stores database query results in additional storage for quick access. 
This mechanism is beneficial in cases if a website needs to process multiple pages per second as 
requests come in and may be helpful in cases when full-page caching cannot be used, e.g. on personalized pages.

[Image Optimization feature](/user-docs/user-docs-shared-pro-cloudlinux/#image-optimization)

[Critical CSS feature](/user-docs/user-docs-shared-pro-cloudlinux/#css-files)

**Premium suite limitations**

* the website must be on an Apache or a LiteSpeed web server;
* the website must be on a server with CloudLinuxOS Shared Pro, Solo, or Admin license
* the website must use one of the following PHP handlers:
  * [php-fpm](https://blog.cpanel.com/how-to-use-php-fpm-with-cpanel/)
  * [lsapi](/cloudlinuxos/cloudlinux_os_components/#apache-mod-lsapi-pro)
* the website must use PHP version 7.2 or higher.
* the WordPress version must be 3.7 and higher.
* no other WordPress Caching plugins must be installed.
* the [Snuffleupagus](https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/) must be turned off.
* WordPress should not be running in Multisite mode.

### Administrator interface

##### Overview

:::tip Note
Resellers' users are not allowed to use AccelerateWP features.
:::

In the _CloudLinux Manager → AccelerateWP_ tab an administrator has the opportunity to provide end-users with a suite of features, which on its turn could be activated by end-users.

![WHM CloudLinux Manager AccelerateWP tab: Premium Features checked, upgrade URL field, CDN section](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPAdminPaidPremium.webp)

Once the feature suite is enabled by the administrator, end-users will see an AccelerateWP tab in their control panel interface and be able to activate the optimization feature.

#### Suites usage statistics
When AccelerateWP is enabled, the AccelerateWP usage statistics are shown.

![AccelerateWP stats dashboard: Active Users and WordPress sites cards and per-user table](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPStats.webp)

It includes:
* `Active Users` block with the total number of users and number of users who have activated the optimization feature/total users
* `Wordpress sites on server` block with a total number of WordPress sites and WordPress sites optimized by the feature
* statistics table

Each row in the statistics table represents a particular user.

The first column `#of Wordpress sites` shows the total number of user's WordPress sites.

The second column `AccelerateWP` shows a number of user's WordPress sites, optimized by the feature.

To enable premium features, click on the "Activate premium features" link and select the options you want. To integrate functions with billing, you must specify the base URL for the purchase of the function by end users.

![WHM CloudLinux Manager AccelerateWP tab: Premium Features checked, upgrade URL field, CDN section](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPAdminPaidPremium.webp)

In case both AccelerateWP and AccelerateWP Premium feature suites are enabled, 
the statistics are extended with AccelerateWP Premium metrics.

![AccelerateWP Premium stats: summary cards and user table with Premium and CDN columns](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPStatsPremium.webp)

Please notice the `AccelerateWP Premium` rows in the `Active Users` and the `Wordpress sites on server` 
blocks, and also the `AccelerateWP Premium` column in the statistics table.

:::tip Note
Newly created users will be accounted for 10 min after adding. 
If you want to get updated statistics immediately, use the "Rescan users websites" button.
:::

#### Filters
You may use the following filters to browse AccelerateWP statistics slices.

![AccelerateWP Show only filter menu open listing WordPress, AccelerateWP, Premium, CDN options](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPFilters.webp)

* `Users with WordPress sites only` filter will show statistics for users who already have WordPress sites; users without WordPress installations will be hidden
* `Users with AccelerateWP only` filter will show statistics for users who utilize the AccelerateWP optimization feature; users who did not activate AccelerateWP feature will be hidden
* `Users with AccelerateWP Premium only` filter will show statistics for users who utilize the AccelerateWP Premium (Object Caching) feature; users who did not activate the AccelerateWP Premium feature will be hidden
* `Users with CDN Free only` filter will show statistics for users who utilize the AccelerateWP CDN feature
* `Users with CDN Pro only` filter will show statistics for users who utilize the AccelerateWP CDN Pro feature


### AccelerateWP CLI

CLI commands for managing AccelerateWP are provided by those utilities:

- `cloudlinux-awp-admin` - for administrator-side actions;
- `cloudlinux-awp-user` - for user-side actions;

[Smart Advice CLI for managing optimization advices](/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/#smart-advice-cli-commands)

Starting from `accelerate-wp-1.6-6` AccelerateWP CLI utilities provide CLI versioning which is defined via `--api-version` option. 

:::tip Note
It is highly recommended to specify CLI version explicitly via --api-version, otherwise CLI will rely on default settings, 
which cannot guarantee backward compatability.
:::

<!----><a name="quick-start-guide-cli"></a>
#### Frequently used commands

##### Find all enabled premium users
*Note: this can also be viewed from the **AccelerateWP** tab in CloudLinux Manager*
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin get-stat
```

##### Enable AccelerateWP Free
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp --allowed-for-all
```

:::tip
Free CDN can only be installed based on SmartAdvice. The 1GB free CDN available only if Advice was given to the site. You can try to trace site via X-Ray, then the Advice might appear but it depends on the current rules for CDN Advice. Thus, the SmartAdvice can decide whenther CDN is not needed for some sites, therefore advice will not appear there. If there is no Advice, it means that that site does not need that type of optimization.

SmartAdvice may determine that certain websites don't require CDN resulting in the absence of Advice for you. If no Advice is provided, it indicates that the particular site doesn't necessitate that specific optimization.

```

##### Enable all features
Use the cloudlinux-awp-admin enable-feature CLI command to ensure the best performance for every WordPress user. This CLI command scans the server for all WordPress sites, then activates the AccelerateWP feature suite. Activation is skipped for any sites with existing page caching or feature incompatibilities.
*Note: Please make sure your AccelerateWP version is >= 1.2-2 before proceeding.*
Scan the server in background mode and activate AccelerateWP on those WordPress sites where it is possible:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin enable-feature --all
```

##### Check feature activation status
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin enable-feature --status
```


#### cloudlinux-awp-admin

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version <api_version> <command>
```

supported commands for `--api-version 1`:

- `set-suite` - manage optimization suites;
- `set-options` - manage server wide settings;
- `get-report` - get per user information about optimization suites statuses (allowed/disallowed) and usage of specific suites;
- `generate-report` - generate information, that is obtained via `get-report` command;
- `get-stat` - get total information about suites statuses (allowed/disallowed/visible) and usage of optimization features;
- `enable-feature` - activate free AccelerateWP feature to all users on the server;
- `object-cache-banner` - manage Redis Object Cache Pro banner visibility in WordPress (hide or show banner for specific WordPress site);

All CLI responses contain `result` field which says was call successful or not.
- `{"result": "success"}`  - in case of successful call
- `{"result": "ERROR_STRING"}` - in case of unsuccessful call, `result` contains string with error details. 
Response also could have `context` field to provide additional error info, e.g: username, optimization suite or feature, etc.
Example:
```
{
    "context": {
        "suite": "accelerate_wp_cdn"
    },
    "result": "Suite %(suite)s is not visible for users and so cannot be allowed in billing. Activate the suite on server first. Contact your hoster if you don`t have an access to the server.",

:::tip Note
Added in accelerate-wp >= 1.6-6
:::

supported features:
- `critical_css`
- `image_optimization`
- `object_cache`
- `cdn`

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 set-options --feature-visible=on --features="<features_comma_separated>"
```

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 set-options --feature-visible=off --features="<features_comma_separated>"
```


To set subscription upgrade url for specific AccelerateWP optimization suite:

for AccelerateWP Premium
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 set-options --suite accelerate_wp_premium --upgrade-url="http://mybilling1.com"
```

for AccelerateWP CDN Pro
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 set-options --suite accelerate_wp_cdn_pro --upgrade-url="http://mybilling2.com"
```

##### Generate AccelerateWP suites report for all users on server

`--api-version 1`

```
 cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version <api_version> generate-report (--all | --status)
```

Start report generation:

```
 cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 generate-report --all
```

It starts data collection in background, so check status of generation by separate command:

```
 cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 generate-report --status
```

Rely on `scan_status` key to ensure scanning is over, for example if it is still in progress:
```
 {
    "last_scan_time": 1690198116,
    "result": "success",
    "scan_status": "in_progress",
    "timestamp": 1690199148.6370175,
    "total_users_scanned": 0,
    "total_users_to_scan": 1
}
```

##### AccelerateWP suites statistics

`--api-version 1`

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version <api_version> get-report (--all | --users=<usernames_comma_separated>)
```

Get suites statistics for all users:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 get-report --all
```

or for a particular user:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 get-report --users=<username>
```

This CLI command returns the following information:
* total number of users in the report -- `total_users_count`
* total number of websites in the report -- `total_wordpress_count`
* total number of users with particular suite enabled -- `total_users_count_active`
* total number of websites with particular suite enabled -- `total_sites_count_active`
* number of websites with a particular suite enabled per each user in the report -- `*_sites_count` in the `users` list
* suites visibility status per each user in the report -- `suites` in the `users` list
  * possible values for visibility status are: `visible`, `allowed`, `disabled`

The example output for a single user is given below:

```
{
    "last_scan_time": 1681198804,
    "result": "success",
    "timestamp": 1681203383.3503218,

                    "status": "allowed"
                },
                "accelerate_wp_premium": {
                    "source": "default",
                    "status": "visible"
                }
            },
            "username": "user16",
            "wp_sites_count": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

##### AccelerateWP features statistics

Get overall AccelerateWP features usage statistics for a server with:

`--api-version 1`

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 get-stat
```

This CLI command returns the following information:
* number of `allowed_users` in `total` and per feature
* number of `visible_users` in `total` and per feature
* number of `allowed_suites` per suite
* number of sites with enabled features in `total` and per feature -- `enabled_sites`
* number of users with visible features in `total` and per feature -- `visible_users`
* features which are currently allowed -- `features_allowed_by_default`
* features which are currently visible -- `features_visible_by_default`

The example output is given below:

```

##### Activate free AccelerateWP for all WordPress sites on the server
`--api-version 1`:

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 enable-feature (--all | --status)
```

Use the that command to ensure the best performance for every end-user. CLI command
scans a server for all WordPress sites and activates the AccelerateWP
free feature suite. It can take up to 2 minutes for a single site. 
CLI command skips activation for WordPress sites with page caching or feature incompatibilities.

:::tip Note
Please make sure your AccelerateWP version is >= 1.2-2 before proceeding.
:::

Scan the server in background mode and activate free AccelerateWP plugin
on those WordPress sites where it is possible:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 enable-feature --all
```
The output will state the number of users for the scan and the
progress state of the process.

Check activation status:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 enable-feature --status
```
The output will be either:
* Activation is still in progress,
* Activation is done. The message will state how many users
were initially for the scan, a number of WordPress sites with
successfully activated suite and the total number of WordPress sites
scanned.

##### AccelerateWP disable Redis Object Cache Pro banner

`--api-version 1`

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 object-cache-banner (--enable | --disable) (--all | --users=<usernames_comma_separated>)
```

Depending on the server settings, the `WP_REDIS_DISABLE_BANNERS` constant will be defined in the `wp-config.php` 
file when the module is activated, which affects the display of promotional materials.

To change the `WP_REDIS_DISABLE_BANNERS` constant for previously installed modules, you need to run a process to update the constant:

Hide on websites where the module is installed
- for all users:  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --all --disable```
- for specific users (users separated by commas):  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --users foo,bar --disable```
- for current user (run under the user):  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-user --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --all --disable```
- for a specific website (run under the user):  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-user --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --wp-path "" --domain "demo.com" --disable```

Display on websites where the module is installed
- for all users:  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --all --enable```
- for specific users (users separated by commas):  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-admin --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --users foo,bar --enable```
- for current user (run under the user):  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-user --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --all --enable```
- for a specific website (run under the user):  
  ```cloudlinux-awp-user --api-version 1 object-cache-banner --wp-path "" --domain "demo.com" --enable```

If the banner was previously disabled/enabled for the user/website, 
then for its subsequent activation of the ObjectCache module, the general settings at the server level will be applied. 
This means that for each user/website we do not store an individual banner disable/enable setting.


##### SmartAdvice email reminders

This section outlines the process of managing email notifications from the SmartAdvice plugins. It applies to all users and it is a global (server-wide) setting.

### Configure redis extension for alt-php

Object cache optimization feature requires several php extensions to be enabled, so there is a script 
`/usr/share/cloudlinux/wpos/enable_redis_for_alt_php.py` which does configuration of
required modules: `redis`, `igbinary`, `json`.

By default, it modifies global php.ini and enables required extensions there.

Starting from `accelerate-wp >= 1.6-7` - to prevent this script of modifying 
global php.ini - create marker file: `/var/clwpos/admin/do_not_modify_global_php.flag`.
In that case, additional custom php ini with required php extension will be created and global php.ini remains unmodified.

### Billing Integration (upsell automation for premium features)
The premium features of AccelerateWP are intended to generate revenue for CloudLinux hosting customers by adding high-end performance value to WordPress that meets or exceeds the value of premium WordPress Hosting/Managed WordPress market leaders. AccelerateWP premium features are suggested to hosting end-users (and WordPress administrators) when substantial data supports a significant performance boost will be achived upon activation. 

#### Setting the upgrade URL
When a premium feature is suggested to the user/admin through our SmartAdvice utility, they will be prompted to upgrade. The upgrade URL is where the user will be sent when they click "upgrade" and this is customizable per server (or fleet). There are 2 common upgrade packaging models that will dictate how this URL is set and you will need to make this decision and configure the upgrade URL before offering AccelerateWP premium. The 2 packaging models are:
1. Include AccelerateWP Premium features in your highest tier hosting plans
2. Offer as an add-on subscription to existing hosting plans

Once you have made this decision, you will need to integrate your billing platform.

#### WHMCS billing

If you use WHMCS, AccelerateWP Premium billing integration is quite simple. CloudLinux developed its own WHMCS plugin which provides this out of the box. 
View our [documentation](/cln/whmcs_advantage/) to learn how to install and use the plugin.

#### Other billing integration

As AccelerateWP Premium is a feature that works on a subscription basis, we made it possible for hosters to integrate their existing billing systems with our plugin and sell the 
feature for their users.

When AccelerateWP Premium is enabled in the admin interface, users get a proposal to upgrade their subscription.

![Upgrade subscription dialog: contact admin for Object cache on cPanel AccelerateWP sites list](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPUpgradeNoLink.webp)

When a user upgrades the subscription to the plan with AccelerateWP support, billing must execute the following command on the server:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp_premium --allowed --source=BILLING_OVERRIDE --users=<username>
```

This command makes two things:
- allow the user to install the plugin, bypassing the upgrade window;
- reports premium as being used to CLN, starting the billing cycle for the hoster.


When the user terminates or downgrades the plan, the following command must be executed by the billing system:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp_premium --default --source=BILLING_OVERRIDE --users=<username>
```

### Setup upgrade URL for AccelerateWP Premium

The upgrade window can be customized with a link to the plan upgrade page, which can be set using the CLI command:

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-options --upgrade-url https://plan.upgrade/splash
```

![Upgrade subscription modal for Object cache with Upgrade subscription and Close buttons](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPUpgradeLink.webp)

AccelerateWP automatically appends GET parameters when the link is displayed.

```
https://plan.upgrade/splash/?m=acceleratewp&action=provisioning&username=democom&domain=demo.com&server_ip=10.51.0.10
```

| Parameter | Value        | Description                                              |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| m         | acceleratewp | Constant.                                                |
| action    | provisioning | Constant.                                                |
| username  | democom      | Customer's account name.                                 |
| domain    | demo.com     | Customer's account primary domain.                       |
| server_ip | 10.51.0.10   | Primary IP of the server where AccelerateWP is installed |

Parameters can be used to determine the billing account of the user in order to display the proper page. 
WHMCS plugin already has an automatic redirect to the upgrade page, there is only needed to set upgrade-url 
to the root of your WHMCS instance.

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-options --upgrade-url https://whmcs.mydomain.zone/
```

Upgrade URL is opened in a modal browser window and will be automatically closed
when AccelerateWP receives a callback about the successful upgrade.

The callback is already implemented in the WHMCS plugin, but if you are using some other billing,
you should add the following code on the page which appears when a user successfully upgrades the subscription.

    <script>
    if(window.opener && !window.opener.closed) {
        window.opener.postMessage('PAYMENT_SUCCESS', '*');
    }
    </script>


In order to remove the link, just set the upgrade URL to the empty one.

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-options --upgrade-url ''
```

### Disable AccelerateWP Premium

If you would like to stop using AccelerateWP Premium, 
click on the `manage` link and remove the `Premium Features` checkbox.
AccelerateWP will be still available for your users.

![Manage dialog: Premium Features checked, SmartAdvice needs X-Ray warning, Save and Cancel](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPDisablePremiumOnly.webp)

### Disable AccelerateWP

If you would like to stop using AccelerateWP completely, toggle the `AccelerateWP` back.
Both AccelerateWP and AccelerateWP Premium will be turned off.

![CloudLinux Manager AccelerateWP on with Premium manage, Rescan, stats cards, users table](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPDisable.webp)

This operation will:
* disable the AccelerateWP tab in the users' control panel interface
* disable all AccelerateWP optimization suites
* deactivate all optimization features for all users

This operation will NOT:
* cancel the subscription made by the user in WHMCS or other billing. The user's subscription stays 
  alive and the user will still be charged in the billing system unless the hoster manually makes a refund


### Logs
The main AccelerateWP log is located at
* `/var/log/clwpos/main.log`


In case AccelerateWP Premium is active, the auxiliary monitoring daemon `clwpos_monitoring` is also activated. Its log is located at
* `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log`


### FAQ

#### With which panel can I use AccelerateWP?

AccelerateWP is compatible with cPanel, Plesk, and DirectAdmin, and it also [supports custom control panel integration](https://blog.cloudlinux.com/acceleratewp-is-now-supporting-custom-control-panel-integration).


#### Is it possible to use AccelerateWP on a non-control panel server?

Yes, if a custom integration mechanism is used: [custom control panel integration](https://blog.cloudlinux.com/acceleratewp-is-now-supporting-custom-control-panel-integration).

#### Do you plan to enable support of the Nginx server?

This is a part of our very long-term plans, thus not expected in the nearest future.

#### How will it help my customers?

AccelerateWP is a complex solution to help your customers increase their WordPress site performance. AccelerateWP brings number of optimization features, like object caching, css and js preprocessing and website preloading.

#### How could I monitor Redis instances while using the AccelerateWP Premium suite?

The Redis process is started for a user after activating the AccelerateWP Premium Object Caching feature for at least one WordPress site.
It is killed after AccelerateWP Premium Object Caching has been deactivated for all user's websites.

Look through the processes list to check the Redis status for a particular user:
```
 ps aux | grep redis  

 awpuser  2662517  0.0  0.5 101096  8512 ?        Sl   15:33   0:00 /opt/alt/redis/bin/redis-server unixsocket:/home/awpuser/.clwpos/redis.sock
```
In case if AccelerateWP Premium is active, the auxiliary monitoring daemon `clwpos_monitoring` is also activated. It checks Redis instances each 5 minutes, starts new instances, restart failed ones and kills the “garbage” instances if needed.
Check daemon status using `service clwpos_monitoring status` and its main log: `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log`.

#### My users are complaining that their features are not installed automatically after a subscription upgrade
This can be caused by several reasons. Either your customer's website was detected to be malfunctioning
or there was an issue with the environment when the feature was installed 
(e.g. bad internet connectivity with the WordPress market).

First, try to enable the feature manually using the AccelerateWP interface. 
Most likely you will find a human-readable error message there.

Next, you can try to dive into `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log` and find the reason why the `enable` command failed.
Here is an example of a successful feature installation for reference:


    2023-02-14 11:01:14,696: (clwpos.daemon_base) [INFO] Running cloudlinux-awp-user enable --feature object_cache --domain wpujj.com --wp-path
    2023-02-14 11:01:15,081: (clwpos.daemon_base) [INFO] Command succeded with output:
    `CompletedProcess(args=['/bin/cagefs_enter.proxied', 'cloudlinux-awp-user', 'enable', '--feature', 'object_cache', '--domain', 'wpujj.com', '--wp-path', ''], returncode=0, 
    stdout='{\n "context": {\n "domain": "wpujj.com",\n "feature": "object_cache"\n  },\n  "result": "success",\n "timestamp": 1676372475.044419,\n \n}\n', stderr='')`
    2023-02-14 11:01:15,086: (clwpos.daemon_base) [INFO] background process finished: pid=415368

Also, some useful notes may be present in the user's log located at `/home/<username>/.clwpos/main.log`.

If the issue persists, or you cannot resolve it yourself, 
contact CloudLinux support and attach `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log` and `/home/<username>/.clwpos/main.log` 
for further investigation.


### Troubleshooting

#### End-users of AccelerateWP Premium feature encounter Redis extension is not installed for selected php version
In order to make use of the AccelerateWP Premium Object Caching feature, the loaded Redis extension is required for the end-user's website.
End-users will not be able to activate the Object Caching feature until the Redis extension configuration is incomplete.

Corresponding incompatibility warning will be displayed in the control panel's User interface:

![Incompatibility dialog: Redis extension missing for selected PHP over My WordPress Sites](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPNoRedis.webp)

The Redis extensions are configured for all installed and supported PHP versions automatically:
* right after the AccelerateWP Premium suite is enabled
* by cron once a day

or you can trigger the utility manually:
```
/usr/sbin/enable_redis_for_panel_php
```

All errors will be displayed in standard output and logged into `/var/log/clwpos/main.log`.


**Ensuring the EA-PHP Redis extension is configured correctly**

1. Check Redis extension package is installed by running the following command

    ```
    rpm -q ea-phpXY-php-redis
    ```
    Install the corresponding extension if it is not present:
    ```
    yum install ea-phpXY-php-redis
    ```
    Consider the example for checking out and installing the Redis extension for `ea-php74`: 
    ```
    rpm -q ea-php74-php-redis
    yum install ea-php74-php-redis
    ```
2. Check Redis `ini` file is present by running the following command:
    ```
    ls /opt/cpanel/ea-phpXY/root/etc/php.d/ | grep 50-redis
    ```
    Consider the example for checking out Redis extension for `ea-php74`: 
    ```
    ls /opt/cpanel/ea-php74/root/etc/php.d/ | grep 50-redis
    ```
    Try reinstalling the package if `ini` file is missing.
3. Make sure the Redis module is loaded under a specific user by running the following command:
    ```
    su -c "php -m | grep redis" <username>
    ```


**Ensuring the ALT-PHP Redis extension is configured correctly**

1. Check if `redis.so` is present for a particular alt-php version:
    ```
    ls /opt/alt/phpXY/usr/lib64/php/modules | grep redis.so
    ```
    Consider the example for checking alt-php74 redis.so:
    ```
    ls /opt/alt/php74/usr/lib64/php/modules | grep redis.so
    redis.so
    ```
2. If the Redis module is missing:
   
   a. Install the `alt-phpXY-pecl-ext` package manually
   b. Run the Redis configuration script `/usr/share/cloudlinux/wpos/enable_redis_for_alt_php.py`
      
   All errors will be displayed in standard output and logged into `/var/log/clwpos/main.log`.
3. If the Redis module is present for a particular php version, but the incompatibility issue persists, re-check the following:
    
    a. Make sure the Redis module is loaded under user:
    ```
    su -c "php -m | grep redis" <username>
    ```
    b. Check the required extensions are enabled in `php.ini`:
    ```
    cat /opt/alt/phpXY/etc/php.ini | grep redis.so
    cat /opt/alt/phpXY/etc/php.ini | grep json.so
    cat /opt/alt/phpXY/etc/php.ini | grep igbinary.so
    ```
    
    c. Enable missing extensions manually.


#### End-users of AccelerateWP encounter PHP-related issues during feature activation
End-users may encounter PHP-related errors while activating the AccelerateWP features.

![Advice modal: PHP cannot load mbstring.so; Close and Try again over sites table](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/accelerate-wp/AWPBrokenPHP.webp)

The general examples of possible reasons are:
* broken PHP binaries
* missing PHP files
* etc.

To check that this issue is caused by PHP itself, call any PHP command, for example:
```
/opt/cpanel/ea-php80/root/usr/bin/php -i
```
And make sure that installed `ea-php80` packages are not broken using
`rpm -V <package_name>`.

Reinstall broken packages if found.

Consider the example issue (presented at the picture above) with broken `mbstring.so` for `ea-php80`:
```
/opt/cpanel/ea-php80/root/usr/bin/php -i
Segmentation fault (core dumped)  

rpm -V ea-php80 

rpm -V ea-php80-php-mbstring
S.5....T.    /opt/cpanel/ea-php80/root/usr/lib64/php/modules/mbstring.so

yum reinstall ea-php80-php-mbstring
```

## MAx Cache documentation 

### Overview 

`mod_maxcache` is an Apache 2.4 module that directly serves static cache files without requiring any mod_rewrite rules in `.htaccess`. The module handles the entire cache lookup internally - computing the cache path, checking for file existence, and serving the static HTML directly.

This design eliminates per-request regex compilation in `.htaccess`, resulting in significantly faster cache delivery. The module is fully compatible with AccelerateWP's cache directory layout and can be used by any caching plugin that follows similar conventions.

AccelerateWP uses this module to serve the correct static page without invoking PHP or writing complex RewriteRule-based configurations. This document summarizes the module's directives and describes how any page cache plugin can integrate with the same capabilities.

The module includes two independent subsystems: **cache serving** (serves pre-generated static HTML files, bypassing PHP) and **full .htaccess caching** (caches parsed `.htaccess` files in shared memory, eliminating per-request disk I/O). Both are included in the same `ea-apache24-mod_maxcache` package and can be enabled independently.

:::warning Note:
MAx Cache is currently supported on cPanel control panels only. 
:::

### MAx Cache Installation

To install MAx Cache, run the following commands: 

```
yum install accelerate-wp cloudlinux-site-optimization-module libmaxcache --enablerepo=cloudlinux-updates-testing 
```
```
yum install ea-apache24-mod_maxcache --enablerepo=cl-ea4-testing
``` 

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ea-apache24-mod_maxcache` | Apache module with cache serving and full .htaccess caching subsystems |
| `libmaxcache` | Shared C library for device detection, WebP, cookie/QS handling |

After installation, the full .htaccess caching subsystem is enabled by default (`MaxCacheHtaccess On`). Change detection uses per-request `stat()` polling — no separate daemon is required.

### MAx Cache Activation Guide 

Use the following commands to manage MAx Cache on your server via the cloudlinux-awp-admin tool. 

:::tip Note on Prerequisites
**Important:** For either command to work, the AccelerateWP plugin must be installed and up-to-date on the WordPress sites you are targeting. Old versions of the plugin do not support the current configuration.
:::

#### 1. Bulk Activation (Server-Wide) 

Use this command to enable MAx Cache for all compatible websites on the server at once. 
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin maxcache enable --all 
```

**What this does:**

* **Mass Deployment:** Activates the MAx Cache feature directly on every compatible WordPress site hosted on the server.
* **Prerequisite:** Ensure the **AccelerateWP plugin** is updated on the target sites before running this. The configuration requires the latest plugin version to apply successfully. 

#### 2. Single Site Activation 

Use this command to enable MAx Cache for a specific WordPress installation. 
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin maxcache --enable --user {USERNAME} --domain {USERDOMAIN} 
```

**Parameters:** 

* `--user {USERNAME}`: Replace `{USERNAME}` with the system username of the account (e.g., `john`).
* `--domain {USERDOMAIN}`: Replace `{USERDOMAIN}` with the specific domain name (e.g., `example.com`). 

### Module Directives 

#### MaxCache 

* **Syntax**: `MaxCache On|Off`
* **Default**: Off
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Master enable/disable switch for all module features. When disabled, the module performs no processing and immediately declines the request. When enabled, the module evaluates eligibility and serves cache files when found.
* **Example**: 
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On
</IfModule>
``` 

#### MaxCachePath

* **Syntax**: `MaxCachePath <template>`
* **Default**: none (required for cache serving)
* **Context**: .htaccess only
* **Description**: Defines the cache file path template using placeholders. This directive is required for the module to serve cache files. The template describes the full path under the document root where cache files are stored.
* **Placeholders**: 

| Placeholder | Description | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| `{HTTP_HOST}` | Request hostname | `example.com` |
| `{REQUEST_URI}` | Request URI (trailing slashes trimmed) | `/article` |
| `{USER_SUFFIX}` | Per-user directory suffix | `-admin-abc123` or empty |
| `{USER_SHARED_SUFFIX}` | Shared logged-in suffix | `-loggedin-abc123` or empty |
| `{QS_SUFFIX}` | Query string suffix | `#color=red` or empty |
| `{MOBILE_SUFFIX}` | Mobile device suffix | `-mobile` or empty |
| `{SSL_SUFFIX}` | HTTPS suffix | `-https` or empty |
| `{WEBP_SUFFIX}` | WebP suffix | `-webp` or empty |
| `{DYNAMIC_COOKIE_SUFFIX}` | Dynamic cookies suffix | `-usd-en` or empty |
| `{GZIP_SUFFIX}` | Gzip suffix | `_gzip` or empty |
* **Example** (standard cache layout): 
```
MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{USER_SUFFIX}{REQUEST_URI}{QS_SUFFIX}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}{WEBP_SUFFIX}{DYNAMIC_COOKIE_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
``` 
This produces cache file paths like:
* `/wp-content/cache/example.com/article/index-https-webp.html_gzip`
* `/wp-content/cache/example.com-admin-secret/index-mobile-https.html` 

#### MaxCacheOptions

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheOptions [+-]TabletAsMobile [+-]SkipCacheOnMobile [+-]ExportVars`
* **Default**: `-TabletAsMobile -SkipCacheOnMobile -ExportVars`
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Options**: 

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `TabletAsMobile` | Treat tablets as mobile devices for both the `-mobile` filename suffix (when `{MOBILE_SUFFIX}` is used) and the `SkipCacheOnMobile` gate. Without `SkipCacheOnMobile`, this option still matters: it changes whether tablets use the `-mobile` cache variant. |
| `SkipCacheOnMobile` | Never serve cached content to mobile devices (and tablets, if `TabletAsMobile` is also enabled). |
| `ExportVars` | Export `CL_DEVICE_TYPE` and `CL_SUPPORTS_WEBP` to subprocess_env| 

* **Description**: Fine-tunes mobile/tablet behavior. The `ExportVars` option provides environment variables for use in `RewriteRule`: `%{ENV:CL_DEVICE_TYPE}` and `%{ENV:CL_SUPPORTS_WEBP}`. We recommend to simply use `MaxCachePath` instead.
* **Example**: 
```
# Treat tablets as mobile
MaxCacheOptions +TabletAsMobile

# Skip cache for all mobile devices
MaxCacheOptions +SkipCacheOnMobile +TabletAsMobile 
``` 

#### MaxCacheExcludeURI 

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheExcludeURI "<regex>"`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Excludes requests whose URI matches the given regex pattern (case-insensitive). Multiple directives can be specified; if any pattern matches, the request is not served from cache. 
    * **Important**: Unlike RewriteCond rules that use `!` for negation, this directive uses **positive matching** — URIs that match are excluded. 
    * **Performance tip**: Using `MaxCacheExcludeURI` patterns like `/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/` is more efficient than wrapping directives in `<If "%{REQUEST_URI} !~ ...">` blocks. The module checks URI exclusions early and declines immediately, avoiding further processing.
* **Example**:
```
# Exclude wp-content, wp-includes, feeds, embeds, and REST API (single efficient pattern)
MaxCacheExcludeURI "/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/|/(?:.+/)?feed(?:/(?:.+/?)?)?$|/(?:.+/)?embed/|/(index.php/)?(.*)wp-json(/.*|$)"

# Exclude WooCommerce cart and checkout
MaxCacheExcludeURI "^/(cart|checkout|my-account)(/|$)"
``` 

#### MaxCacheExcludeUA 

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheExcludeUA "<regex>"`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Excludes requests from User-Agents that match the given regex pattern (case-insensitive). Commonly used to exclude bots that should see fresh content.
* **Example**:
```
# Exclude Facebook and WhatsApp crawlers
MaxCacheExcludeUA "^(facebookexternalhit|WhatsApp).*"
``` 

#### MaxCacheExcludeCookie 

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheExcludeCookie "<regex>"`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Excludes requests whose raw `Cookie` header matches the given regex pattern (case-insensitive). Used to bypass cache for logged-in users or users with specific session cookies.
* **Example**: 
```
# Exclude logged-in users, password-protected posts, etc.
MaxCacheExcludeCookie "(wordpress_logged_in_.+|wp-postpass_|wptouch_switch_toggle|comment_author_|comment_author_email_)" 
``` 

#### MaxCacheMandatoryCookies 

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheMandatoryCookies <cookie1> [<cookie2> ...]`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Declares cookie names that **must be present** in the request for cache serving to occur. If any mandatory cookie is missing, the request falls back to PHP. Useful for gated content or opt-in caching scenarios.
* **Example**:  
```
# Only serve cache if user has accepted cookies
MaxCacheMandatoryCookies cookie_consent 
``` 

#### MaxCacheDynamicCookies 

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheDynamicCookies <token> [<token> ...]`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Declares cookie names whose values become part of the cache filename via `{DYNAMIC_COOKIE_SUFFIX}`. Supports both scalar cookies (`currency`) and nested cookies (`preferences[language]`).
* **Normalization**:
    * Cookie values are sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` (others become `-`)
    * Result is lowercased
    * Underscores are converted to hyphens
    * Each value is prefixed with `-`
* **Example**:
```
# Cache varies by currency and language
MaxCacheDynamicCookies currency language

# Request with Cookie: currency=USD; language=en_US
# Results in suffix: -usd-en-us
# Full filename: index-https-usd-en-us.html
```

#### MaxCacheQSAllowedParams 

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheQSAllowedParams <param1> [<param2> ...]`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Declares query parameters that enable query-string cache variants. When at least one allowlisted parameter is present, the module:
    * Removes any keys listed in `MaxCacheQSIgnoredParams`
    * Sorts remaining keys ascending
    * Builds a normalized query string
    * Appends `#<normalized_query>` to the cache directory path via `{QS_SUFFIX}`
    * If no allowlisted parameter is present, requests with query strings are not served from cache (fall back to PHP).
* **Example:**
```
# Allow caching for search and pagination
MaxCacheQSAllowedParams s paged

# Request: /search/?s=hello&page=2
# Cache path includes: #paged=2&s=hello
```

#### MaxCacheQSIgnoredParams

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheQSIgnoredParams <param1> [<param2> ...]`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Declares query parameters that are removed from the cache key. These parameters never affect cache variants—they're stripped before the query string is normalized.
* **Example**:
```
# Ignore tracking parameters
MaxCacheQSIgnoredParams utm_source utm_medium utm_campaign fbclid gclid

# Request: /products/?color=red&utm_source=google
# Cache key uses only: #color=red
```

#### MaxCacheIgnoreHeaders

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheIgnoreHeaders "Header-Name: Substring"`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Skip cache serving for requests carrying specific headers. The header value is checked for substring match.
* **Example**:
```
# Don't serve cache for AJAX requests
MaxCacheIgnoreHeaders "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"
```

#### MaxCacheLoggedHash

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheLoggedHash "<secret_key>"`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
* **Description**: Sets the secret key used for logged-in user cache directories.
* **Example**:
```
MaxCacheLoggedHash "your-secret-key"
``` 

### Integration Guide for Plugin Developers 

This guide walks you through integrating `mod_maxcache` with your caching plugin. We'll start with the absolute basics and progressively add features until we reach a battle-tested production configuration. 

:::tip Philosophy:  
Each step builds on the previous one. Copy the final configuration that matches your needs, or follow along to understand how each piece works. 
:::

#### Step 1: Basic Caching
The simplest possible configuration — just two lines to start serving cached pages:
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On
    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index.html
</IfModule>
```

**What this does**:
* Serves `/wp-content/cache/example.com/about-us/index.html` for requests to `https://example.com/about-us/`
* Falls through to PHP if the cache file doesn't exist

**Cache path breakdown**: 
| Request | Cache File |
|---|---|
| `https://example.com/`  | `/wp-content/cache/example.com/index.html` |
| `https://example.com/blog/`  | `/wp-content/cache/example.com/blog/index.html` |
| `https://example.com/products/widget`/ | `/wp-content/cache/example.com/products/widget/index.html` | 

####  Step 2: HTTPS Awareness with {SSL_SUFFIX} 

Most sites serve different content (or at least different URLs) over HTTP vs HTTPS. Add `{SSL_SUFFIX}` to create separate cache files: 
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On
    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index{SSL_SUFFIX}.html
</IfModule>
```
**What changes**:
* HTTPS requests → `index-https.html`
* HTTP requests → `index.html`

| Request | Cache File |
|---|---|
| `https://example.com/` | `.../example.com/index-https.html` |
| `http://example.com/` | `.../example.com/index.html` |

#### Step 3: Mobile-Optimized Caching with {MOBILE_SUFFIX} 

Serve different cached pages to mobile devices—critical for sites with responsive designs that differ significantly between desktop and mobile: 
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On
    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html
</IfModule>
``` 
**What changes**:
* Desktop requests → `index-https.html`
* Mobile requests → `index-mobile-https.html`

The module uses intelligent User-Agent detection to identify mobile devices. No configuration needed — it just works.

| Device | Request | Cache File |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop | `https://example.com/` | `index-https.html` |
| iPhone | `https://example.com/` | `index-mobile-https.html` |
| iPad | `https://example.com/` | `index-https.html` (tablets = desktop by default) |

:::tip Tip: 
Want tablets treated as mobile? Add `MaxCacheOptions +TabletAsMobile` 
:::

#### Step 4: Gzip Compression Support 

Serve pre-compressed cache files for faster delivery. Just add the gzip suffix: 

```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On
    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule>
```

**What changes**:
* Cache files now end with `.html_gzip` for browser which support gzip encoding
* Apache serves these with proper `Content-Encoding: gzip` headers
* Browsers decompress automatically — users see faster load times
* Clients without gzip support still get non-compressed `.html` cache files

#### Step 5: Protecting Dynamic Content with Exclusions 

Not everything should be cached. Add exclusion rules to bypass the cache for dynamic content: 
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On

    # Bypass cache for feeds, embeds, REST API, and WordPress internals
    MaxCacheExcludeURI "/(?:.+/)?feed(?:/(?:.+/?)?)?$|/(?:.+/)?embed/|/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/|/(index.php/)?(.*)wp-json(/.*|$)"

    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule> 
```

**What this excludes**:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---|---|
| `/feed/` | RSS/Atom feeds at any level |
| `/embed/` | Embed endpoints |
| `/wp-content/`, `/wp-includes/` | Static assets (let Apache handle directly) |
| `/wp-json/` | REST API calls |

:::tip 
Why positive matching? Unlike RewriteCond's `!` negation, `MaxCacheExcludeURI` uses positive matching — patterns that match are _excluded_. This is more intuitive: "exclude URIs that look like this." 
:::

#### Step 6: Handling Bots and Crawlers 

Some bots need fresh content. Exclude them by User-Agent:
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On

    MaxCacheExcludeURI "/(?:.+/)?feed(?:/(?:.+/?)?)?$|/(?:.+/)?embed/|/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/|/(index.php/)?(.*)wp-json(/.*|$)"

    # Facebook and WhatsApp crawlers should see fresh content for link previews
    MaxCacheExcludeUA "^(facebookexternalhit|WhatsApp).*"

    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule>
```

#### Step 7: Logged-In Users and Session Cookies 

Exclude users with active sessions—they need dynamic, personalized content:
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On

    MaxCacheExcludeURI "/(?:.+/)?feed(?:/(?:.+/?)?)?$|/(?:.+/)?embed/|/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/|/(index.php/)?(.*)wp-json(/.*|$)"
    MaxCacheExcludeUA "^(facebookexternalhit|WhatsApp).*"

    # Bypass cache for logged-in users and special sessions
    MaxCacheExcludeCookie "(wordpress_logged_in_.+|wp-postpass_|wptouch_switch_toggle|comment_author_|comment_author_email_)"

    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule> 
```
**Cookies that bypass cache**:
| Cookie Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `wordpress_logged_in_*` | Logged-in WordPress users |
| `wp-postpass_*` | Password-protected post access |
| `wptouch_switch_toggle` | Mobile theme switcher |
| `comment_author_*` | Users who've commented (name/email remembered) |

#### Step 8: Query String Intelligence with {QS_SUFFIX} 

By default, URLs with query strings bypass the cache. But some query strings _should_ be cached — like search results or paginated content. 
``` 
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On

    # Cache these query parameters (search, pagination, language)
    MaxCacheQSAllowedParams lang s permalink_name lp-variation-id

    MaxCacheExcludeURI "/(?:.+/)?feed(?:/(?:.+/?)?)?$|/(?:.+/)?embed/|/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/|/(index.php/)?(.*)wp-json(/.*|$)"
    MaxCacheExcludeUA "^(facebookexternalhit|WhatsApp).*"
    MaxCacheExcludeCookie "(wordpress_logged_in_.+|wp-postpass_|wptouch_switch_toggle|comment_author_|comment_author_email_)"

    # Add {QS_SUFFIX} to include query string in cache path
    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}{QS_SUFFIX}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule> 
```
**How query strings become cache paths:**
| Request | Cache Directory |
|---|---|
| `/?s=hello` | `.../example.com#s=hello/` |
| `/?lang=en&s=test` | `.../example.com#lang=en&s=test/` |
| `/?random=xyz` | ❌ _Not cached (param not in allowlist)_ |

:::tip Key insight:  
Only requests with at least one allowed parameter get cached. Unknown query strings fall through to PHP.
:::

#### Step 9: Stripping Tracking Parameters 

Marketing tools add tracking parameters (utm_source, fbclid, etc.) that create cache pollution. Strip them: 
``` 
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On

    MaxCacheQSAllowedParams lang s permalink_name lp-variation-id

    # These parameters are stripped before computing the cache key
    MaxCacheQSIgnoredParams utm_source utm_medium utm_campaign fbclid gclid

    MaxCacheExcludeURI "/(?:.+/)?feed(?:/(?:.+/?)?)?$|/(?:.+/)?embed/|/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/|/(index.php/)?(.*)wp-json(/.*|$)"
    MaxCacheExcludeUA "^(facebookexternalhit|WhatsApp).*"
    MaxCacheExcludeCookie "(wordpress_logged_in_.+|wp-postpass_|wptouch_switch_toggle|comment_author_|comment_author_email_)"

    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}{QS_SUFFIX}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule>
```

**The magic:**
| Request | Effective Cache Key |
|---|---|
| `/?s=hello&utm_source=google` | `#s=hello (utm_source stripped)` |
| `/?fbclid=abc123` | ❌ _Falls to PHP (no allowed params remain)_ |
| `/?s=test&gclid=xyz&lang=en` | `#lang=en&s=test (gclid stripped, sorted)` |

#### Step 10: Behavior Fine-Tuning with `MaxCacheOptions`
Control mobile handling and enable environment variable export:
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On

    # -SkipCacheOnMobile: Serve cache to mobile (default)
    # -TabletAsMobile: Tablets use desktop cache (default)
    MaxCacheOptions -SkipCacheOnMobile -TabletAsMobile

    MaxCacheQSAllowedParams lang s permalink_name lp-variation-id
    MaxCacheQSIgnoredParams utm_source utm_medium utm_campaign fbclid gclid

    MaxCacheExcludeURI "/(?:.+/)?feed(?:/(?:.+/?)?)?$|/(?:.+/)?embed/|/(?:wp-content|wp-includes)/|/(index.php/)?(.*)wp-json(/.*|$)"
    MaxCacheExcludeUA "^(facebookexternalhit|WhatsApp).*"
    MaxCacheExcludeCookie "(wordpress_logged_in_.+|wp-postpass_|wptouch_switch_toggle|comment_author_|comment_author_email_)"

    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}{QS_SUFFIX}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule>
```

**Options explained:**
| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-SkipCacheOnMobile` | Mobile devices ARE served from cache (default) |
| `+SkipCacheOnMobile` | Mobile devices always hit PHP |
| `-TabletAsMobile` | Tablets use desktop cache variant (default) |
| `+TabletAsMobile` | Tablets use mobile cache variant |
| `+ExportVars` | Provides `%{ENV:CL_DEVICE_TYPE}` and `%{ENV:CL_SUPPORTS_WEBP}` for use in `.htaccess`. Use only if you rely on `RewriteRule` to build up cache file paths (not recommended) | 

#### Production-Ready Configuration 

Here's the complete, battle-tested configuration with comprehensive tracking parameter coverage: 
```
<IfModule maxcache_module>
    MaxCache On
    MaxCacheOptions -SkipCacheOnMobile -TabletAsMobile

    MaxCacheQSAllowedParams lang s permalink_name lp-variation-id

    # Cache varies by these cookie values
    MaxCacheDynamicCookies currency language

    # {DYNAMIC_COOKIE_SUFFIX} adds -usd-en style suffixes
    MaxCachePath /wp-content/cache/{HTTP_HOST}{REQUEST_URI}/index{MOBILE_SUFFIX}{SSL_SUFFIX}{DYNAMIC_COOKIE_SUFFIX}.html{GZIP_SUFFIX}
</IfModule> 
```
**Result**: `Cookie: currency=USD; language=en` → `index-https-usd-en.html_gzip` 

### Cache Path Construction 

For a complete understanding, here's how the module builds cache paths: 

1. Eligibility checks (in order):
    - Is `MaxCache` On?
    - Is request method `GET`?
    - For query strings: is at least one `MaxCacheQSAllowedParams` key present? (if not, request is declined)
    - Do any `MaxCacheIgnoreHeaders` match?
    - Do any `MaxCacheExcludeURI` patterns match?
    - Do any `MaxCacheExcludeUA` patterns match?
    - Do any `MaxCacheExcludeCookie` patterns match?
    - Are all `MaxCacheMandatoryCookies` present?
    - Is `MaxCacheOptions +SkipCacheOnMobile` enabled and device is mobile/tablet?

2. Template evaluation (lazy, only if eligible):
    - Parse `MaxCachePath` into segments
    - Evaluate each placeholder as needed
    - Build complete cache URI

3. File lookup:
    - Construct filesystem path: `<DocumentRoot><cache_uri>`
    - Check if file exists and is a regular file
    - If found: rewrite request to serve static file
    - If not found: decline (request falls through to PHP) 

### Performance Notes 

The module is designed for maximum performance:
* **No RewriteRule parsing**: The module handles cache logic internally, avoiding per-request regex compilation in `.htaccess`
* **Lazy evaluation**: Template placeholders are only evaluated for eligible requests
* **Regex caching**: Exclusion patterns are compiled once and cached across requests
* **Early exit**: Non-cacheable requests (wrong method, excluded, etc.) exit quickly without file I/O

Benchmarks show significant improvements over RewriteRule-based caching, especially for high-traffic sites with complex `.htaccess` configurations. 

### AccelerateWP plugin limitation 

MAx Cache will not work in AccelerateWP when:
* The site is a WordPress Multisite (the MAx Cache .htaccess block is skipped).
* The site language is Korean (ko_KR) (the MAx Cache .htaccess block is skipped).
* Using the AccelerateWP PHP filter to replace dots with underscores.
* Using the AccelerateWP PHP filter forces the full path to cache files instead of using DOCUMENT_ROOT. 

### Full .htaccess caching

Full .htaccess caching is the second subsystem of `mod_maxcache`. It caches parsed `.htaccess` files in shared memory, so Apache does not re-read and re-parse them from disk on every request. On shared-hosting servers with thousands of sites, this eliminates thousands of `stat()` and `open()` syscalls per second.

Full .htaccess caching benefits **all** `.htaccess`-heavy sites regardless of whether MAx Cache page caching is enabled.

#### How it works

By default, Apache re-reads and re-parses `.htaccess` files from disk on every request. On shared-hosting servers with thousands of sites, this creates significant disk I/O overhead. Full .htaccess caching parses each `.htaccess` once (on first request) and stores the result in shared memory so all Apache workers can reuse it without touching the disk again. The cache populates lazily as traffic arrives.

#### Change detection

Full .htaccess caching detects `.htaccess` changes through per-request `stat()` polling. Each cached entry on the current request path is checked against disk when its per-entry timer expires (controlled by `MaxCacheHtaccessRevalidateInterval`).

| `MaxCacheHtaccessRevalidateInterval` | Detection latency | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` (default) | Immediate (next request) | Every request `stat()`s each cached directory on its path |
| `N` seconds | Up to `N` seconds | Fewer `stat()` syscalls on busy paths, slower change pick-up |

With the default value of `0`, any `.htaccess` create, modify, or delete is detected on the very next request through that directory — no separate daemon is required.

#### Configuration directives

All full .htaccess caching directives go inside `<IfModule mod_maxcache.c>` in the Apache configuration. Full .htaccess caching is configured in `/etc/apache2/conf.d/maxcache_htaccess.conf`.

#### MaxCacheHtaccess

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheHtaccess On|Off`
* **Default**: On (in shipped config)
* **Context**: server config, virtual host
* **Description**: Master enable/disable switch for the full .htaccess caching subsystem.

#### MaxCacheHtaccessRevalidateInterval

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheHtaccessRevalidateInterval <seconds>`
* **Default**: 0
* **Range**: 0–3600
* **Context**: server config, virtual host
* **Description**: Minimum seconds between `mtime` revalidation checks per cached entry on the request path. With the default of `0`, each entry is `stat()`'d on every request through that path for immediate change detection. Larger values reduce `stat()` syscall traffic on busy paths at the cost of slower pick-up of `.htaccess` edits.

#### MaxCacheHtaccessEntries

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheHtaccessEntries <count>`
* **Default**: 50000
* **Range**: 10–500000
* **Context**: server config, virtual host
* **Description**: Maximum number of cached `.htaccess` entries in shared memory. When this limit is reached, new directories fall back to Apache's standard processing.

#### MaxCacheHtaccessMemorySize

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheHtaccessMemorySize <MB>`
* **Default**: auto (derived from `MaxCacheHtaccessEntries`)
* **Range**: 1–4096
* **Context**: server config, virtual host
* **Description**: Shared memory arena size in megabytes. Normally sized automatically — only set this if you see `maxcache-htaccess: arena memory exhausted` in the error log.

#### MaxCacheHtaccessExclude

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheHtaccessExclude <path> [path2] ...`
* **Default**: none
* **Context**: server config, virtual host
* **Description**: Exclude directory trees from full .htaccess caching. The path is matched as a prefix.
* **Example**:
```
MaxCacheHtaccessExclude /home/staging /tmp
```

#### MaxCacheHtaccessMaxFileSize

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheHtaccessMaxFileSize <KB>`
* **Default**: 256
* **Range**: 0–10240
* **Context**: server config, virtual host
* **Description**: Maximum `.htaccess` file size (in KB) that full .htaccess caching will process. Files exceeding this limit are skipped and served via Apache's standard processing. Set to `0` for unlimited.

#### MaxCacheHtaccessMaxEntriesPerDocroot

* **Syntax**: `MaxCacheHtaccessMaxEntriesPerDocroot <count>`
* **Default**: 256
* **Range**: 0–100000
* **Context**: server config, virtual host
* **Description**: Maximum cached entries under a single document root. Prevents one user from monopolizing the shared cache on multi-tenant servers. Set to `0` for unlimited (the global `MaxCacheHtaccessEntries` limit still applies).

#### Configuration examples

##### Minimal setup

```
MaxCacheHtaccess On
```

Enables full .htaccess caching globally with default settings (50,000 max entries, 60-second revalidation).

##### Production shared hosting

For a server with ~5,000 WordPress sites:

```
<IfModule mod_maxcache.c>
    MaxCacheHtaccess On
    MaxCacheHtaccessEntries 100000
</IfModule>
```

##### Per-vhost with exclusions

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /home/example/public_html

    MaxCacheHtaccess On
    MaxCacheHtaccessEntries 10000
    MaxCacheHtaccessExclude /home/example/public_html/tmp
</VirtualHost>
```

##### Disable full .htaccess caching for a specific vhost

Enable globally but opt out specific vhosts:

```
# httpd.conf (global)
MaxCacheHtaccess On

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName staging.example.com
    DocumentRoot /home/staging/public_html
    MaxCacheHtaccess Off
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Status endpoint

Full .htaccess caching provides a status handler for monitoring. To enable it, add a `<Location>` block to your Apache configuration:

```
<Location /maxcache-htaccess-status>
    SetHandler maxcache-htaccess-status
    Require local
</Location>
```

Then query it:

```
curl -s http://localhost/maxcache-htaccess-status
```

Example output:

```
MaxCache Htaccess Caching Status
================================

Mode: lazy on-demand
Enabled: yes
Ready: yes
Entries: 1234 / 50000
Lazy compiles: 5678
PCRE mode: shared (GOT patched)

Arena Architecture: Base + Patch Pool + Shadow
Active Base: Arena A
Arena size: 50MB each (x 2)
Arena usage: 8192KB / 50MB (16%)
Patch Pool: 256KB / 12MB used (2%)
Compacting: no
Compaction threshold: 80%

Revalidate interval: 0s

Cache (global):
  Hits:     45000
  Misses:   1234
```

Key fields to check:

| Field | Healthy value | Problem indicator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enabled | `yes` | `no` — full .htaccess caching is turned off in config |
| Ready | `yes` | `no` — engine failed to initialize |
| Entries | below max | at max — increase `MaxCacheHtaccessEntries` |
| Arena usage | below 90% | above 90% — increase `MaxCacheHtaccessMemorySize` |
| Hits | increasing | staying at 0 — full .htaccess caching is not serving cached results |

:::warning
The status endpoint should be restricted to localhost or trusted IPs. Remove or restrict the `<Location>` block in production.
:::

#### Troubleshooting

| Check | Command | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module loaded? | `httpd -M 2>&1 \| grep maxcache` | `maxcache_module` listed |
| Config valid? | `httpd -t` | `Syntax OK` |
| File too large? | `wc -c /path/to/.htaccess` | Under 256 KB (default `MaxCacheHtaccessMaxFileSize`) |
| Path excluded? | `grep MaxCacheHtaccessExclude /etc/apache2/conf.d/maxcache_htaccess.conf` | Path not listed |
| Log: `maxcache-htaccess: entry limit reached (50000/50000), skipping /path` | Cache is full — increase `MaxCacheHtaccessEntries` | Remaining directories use standard Apache processing |
| Log: `maxcache-htaccess: per-docroot entry limit reached (256/256) for /home/user` | Single user filled their quota — increase `MaxCacheHtaccessMaxEntriesPerDocroot` | Other users are not affected |
| Log: `maxcache-htaccess: arena memory exhausted (400MB/400MB)` | Shared memory arena is full — increase `MaxCacheHtaccessMemorySize` | Restart Apache after changing |

If changes must take effect immediately, restart Apache: `systemctl restart httpd`.

## MAx Cache for NGINX

### Overview

MAx Cache for NGINX (`ea-nginx-maxcache`) is the NGINX counterpart of the [Apache MAx Cache module](/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/#max-cache-documentation) . It serves pre-generated static HTML cache files produced by AccelerateWP directly from disk, bypassing PHP on cache hits. The module shares the same `libmaxcache` core library as the Apache module for device detection, WebP support, cookie handling, and query-string normalization.

:::tip 
MAx Cache for NGINX is currently supported on cPanel control panels only. 
:::

### Installation

```
yum install accelerate-wp cloudlinux-site-optimization-module libmaxcache libmaxcache-configd --enablerepo=cloudlinux-updates-testing
yum install ea-nginx-maxcache --enablerepo=cl-ea4-testing
```

This pulls in all required dependencies:

| Package               | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ea-nginx-maxcache`   | NGINX dynamic module (`.so` file) and module loader config      |
| `libmaxcache`         | Shared C library for device detection, WebP, cookie/QS handling |
| `libmaxcache-configd` | Configuration daemon: parses `.htaccess`, writes shared memory  |

Verify the module is loaded:

```
nginx -T 2>&1 | grep maxcache
# Expected: load_module "/usr/lib64/nginx/modules/ngx_http_maxcache_module.so";
```

The `maxcache-configd` daemon is enabled automatically on package install:

```
systemctl status maxcache-configd
journalctl -u maxcache-configd -f
```

### Supported modes

#### Default: automatic via maxcache-configd daemon

In the default mode, the `maxcache-configd` daemon reads AccelerateWP `.htaccess` directives and writes parsed per-domain configuration to shared memory (`/dev/shm/maxcache_config`). The NGINX module reads this shared memory on each request. No manual NGINX configuration is needed per domain.

The `maxcache_dynamic` directive (enabled by default) and `maxcache_shm_path` are the only `http`-level directives required. The `ea-nginx-maxcache` package configures them automatically.

#### ea-nginx reverse proxy (proxy\_pass)

NGINX sits in front of Apache. On a cache hit, the module serves the file directly and Apache is never contacted. On a miss, the request is proxied to Apache as usual.

#### ea-nginx standalone (fastcgi\_pass)

NGINX handles all traffic without Apache. PHP requests go to PHP-FPM via `fastcgi_pass`. On a cache hit, the module serves the file directly and PHP-FPM is never contacted.

#### Manual NGINX configuration

For domains not managed by AccelerateWP, static directives (`maxcache on`, `maxcache_path`, exclusions, etc.) can be set directly in `nginx.conf` or included config files. These also serve as fallbacks when the daemon does not have configuration for a domain.

### Activation

Use the `cloudlinux-awp-admin` tool to enable MAx Cache:

```
# Enable for all compatible sites on the server
cloudlinux-awp-admin maxcache enable --all

# Enable for a specific site
cloudlinux-awp-admin maxcache --enable --user {USERNAME} --domain {USERDOMAIN}
```

:::tip
The AccelerateWP plugin must be installed and up-to-date on the target WordPress sites. 
:::

### Known issues

#### mod\_ruid2 and NGINX standalone mode

:::warning 
When using NGINX in **standalone mode** (without Apache), `mod_ruid2` can cause permission issues. 
:::

`mod_ruid2` changes file ownership to match the site owner's UID/GID. Cache files may end up with restrictive permissions (e.g., `0700`) that the NGINX `nobody` user cannot read, resulting in cache misses.

**Symptoms:**

* NGINX always passes requests to the backend despite MaxCache being enabled.
* NGINX error log shows `permission denied` when opening cache files.

**Resolution:**

1. Grant group read access to cache directories:

```
chmod -R g+rX /home/username/public_html/wp-content/cache/
```

2. Or use ACLs:

```
setfacl -R -m u:nobody:rX /home/username/public_html/wp-content/cache/
setfacl -R -d -m u:nobody:rX /home/username/public_html/wp-content/cache/
```

3. Or switch to **ea-nginx reverse proxy (proxy\_pass) mode** (recommended when `mod_ruid2` is active).

### Configuration directives

All directives below map directly to their [Apache MAx Cache counterparts](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/#max-cache-documentation) . In most deployments with `maxcache_dynamic on` (the default), these are managed automatically by the daemon.

#### maxcache

Enables or disables the module.

**Syntax:** `maxcache on | off;` **Default:** `off` **Context:** `http`, `server`, `location`

### Troubleshooting

**Module not loaded:**

```
nginx -T 2>&1 | grep maxcache
```

**Cache files missing or wrong permissions:**

```
ls -la /home/user/public_html/wp-content/cache/example.com/
sudo -u nobody test -r /home/user/public_html/wp-content/cache/example.com/index-https.html && echo "OK" || echo "Permission denied"
```

**Daemon not running:**

```
systemctl status maxcache-configd
journalctl -u maxcache-configd --since "1 hour ago"
ls -la /dev/shm/maxcache_config
```

**Force rescan after migrations:**

```
systemctl reload maxcache-configd
```

**Check domain is registered in daemon:**

```
echo '{"action":"status"}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/opt/cloudlinux/maxcache/notify.sock
```

**Debug logging:**

```
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log debug;
```

Look for entries prefixed with `maxcache:`.


## Centralized Monitoring

### Description

<span class="notranslate">Centralized Monitoring</span> is a tool that allows hosting administrators to monitor load for all their servers and users.

<span class="notranslate">Centralized Monitoring</span> allows you to:

* View system metrics for all clients’ end servers
* View the LVE statistics per user for all clients’ end servers
* Enable AccelerateWP Free on all compatible servers

### Installation

:::tip Note
Make sure that `cm.cloudlinux.com` is available on your end server.
:::

1. Make sure you have a CloudLinux OS Shared Pro subscription.
2. Make sure you have installed the latest **lve-utils** package. You can install or update it with the following commands:
    * installation
    ```
    yum install lve-utils
    ```
    * update
    ```
    yum update lve-utils
    ```
3. Log in to the [https://cm.cloudlinux.com/](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/) using CLN credentials (if you are already logged in via CLN, authorization via CM is not necessary, it uses SSO).
4. Activate statistics collection on all your servers via the [Centralized Monitoring UI](https://cm.cloudlinux.com) or via the [CLN UI](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/cloudlinux/centralized-monitoring). Optionally, activate the [AccelerateWP Free](/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/#acceleratewp-suite)* for all of your compatible servers.
    ![CLN C-Monitoring view: Centralized Monitoring and AccelerateWP cards with ACTIVATE buttons](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMInstallationProd.webp) Additionally, it is possible to activate the [AccelerateWP Premium](/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/#acceleratewp-premium-suite)* for all compatible servers.
    ![CLN Select features modal: Premium Features and customer upgrade link, Cancel and Activate](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMInstallationPremium.webp)
5. Within couple minutes after the activation, statistics collection and sending to the central server, [AccelerateWP Free](/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/#acceleratewp-suite)* and [AccelerateWP Premium](/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/#acceleratewp-premium-suite) * will be set up automatically: all required packages and components will be installed. For new, just registered servers, actions can take up to 5 hours.
6. Make sure you have activated statistics collection (see paragraph 4) otherwise you will not be able to set up your servers. For instant set up of a registered server after statistics collection was enabled, run the following commands for all servers:
    ```
    rhn_check	
    /usr/share/cloudlinux/cl_plus/manage_clplus enable
    ```
    **Note**: If the `rhn_check` command is not found, run the following command:
    ```
    yum install/update rhn-check rhn-setup
    ```
   AccelerateWP Premium activation support was added in ```lve-utils-6.5.11-1```.
7. After 5 hours (or after the manual setup), check that statistics for all registered servers is collected via [https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers). And check that user statistics on the servers is collected via [https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/users](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/users).
    :::tip Note
    User statistics will be available only for users that were loaded starting from connecting the server to the Centralized Monitoring.
    :::


\* AccelerateWP Free activation also automatically installs and configures 
[Autotracing](/cloudlinuxos/command-line_tools/#x-ray-autotracing) on server.


### Centralized Monitoring: mode without session expired

Users can monitor server’s or user’s load for a long time using the mode without session expired.

To turn on the mode without session expired, follow the next steps:

1. Log in to the [cln.cloudlinux.com](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/) via your account
2. Open the [cm.cloudlinux.com](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers) in a new browser tab/window (please, use the same browser as in step 1)
3. Use the toggle to turn on/off 10 min auto logout

    ![User menu dropdown: 10 min auto logout toggle off and Logout link](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/AutoLogout.webp)

Your session in the [cln.cloudlinux.com](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/) will expire in 10 min. But your session in the [cm.cloudlinux.com](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers) will not expire while your browser tab remains open.


### Centralized Monitoring user interface


You can access <span class="notranslate">Centralized Monitoring</span> in your [CLN account](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/).
Click <span class="notranslate">C-Monitoring</span> in the left menu.

![Centralized Monitoring Servers tab in CLN: hostname search, Refresh, metrics table row](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMCLNAccount.webp)

#### Servers


This page contains the list of all clients’ end servers. The server appears in the list after finishing [Installation](./#installation-2). By default, there is a descending sort by CPU usage.

![All Servers table: load avg, CPU %, memory used/total bars, IO read/write per hostname](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAllServers.webp)

The following values are available for each server:

* <span class="notranslate">**Load Avg 15m**</span> – average system load for the last 15 min
* <span class="notranslate">**CPU Usage**</span> – CPU usage for the last 15 min (the number of cores can be found in the hint)
* <span class="notranslate">**Memory Usage**</span> – free available memory, the second value is the total memory for the last 15 min
* <span class="notranslate">**IO read/write**</span> – disk read bytes/disk written bytes for the last 15 min

:::tip Note
The values are calculated using a 15 min time period but the metric state is updated automatically every minute by default or you can choose from one of the predefined periods.
:::

* <span class="notranslate">**Idle state**</span> – there were no statistics for the server for the last minute. 
* <span class="notranslate">**N/A state**</span> – there were no statistics for the server for the last 30 days. This can happen if a new server was added but statistics sending was not configured.

There is no pagination on the <span class="notranslate">_All servers_</span> page and all columns can be sorted by absolute value.
Use the search tool to operate with the data.

#### Servers details

To get the detailed statistics for the server via charts, click a desired server line in the table.
All charts are auto-refreshed and there is an ability to select the period for metrics data to be updated for the chart.

:::warning Note
In the current version, we collect these metrics for the cPanel end servers only. We are planning to add other panels support soon.
:::

:::warning Note
In the current version, we collect these metrics only for Apache (NOT for LiteSpeed, Nginx, etc.). The charts will be empty for LiteSpeed, Nginx, etc..
:::

#### MySQL queries

![MySQL queries line chart with disclaimer if MySQL unused; Queries legend stats](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMMySQLQueries.webp)

MySQL queries collector gets number of queries executed on the server per minute. It takes data from the MySQL server variable "Questions". You may manually check variable value by executing query `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Questions';`. For more information about MySQL server variables - please, see MySQL documentation.

#### The most loaded server users for the last minute

![Top 5 Users table: CPU, PMem, IOPS, IO bars, MySQL columns, orange Refresh](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMMostLoadedUsers.webp)

We calculate the user’s load by LVE statistics that we collect on the end server.
The idle state for the user means that the LVE statistics were not collected for the last minute for some reason.

In each cell there are current usage/limit values for the basic LVE limits:

* CPU Usage
* Entry Processes
* Physical Memory Usage
* IOPS
* IO Usage
* Number of Processes
* MySQL CPU
* MySQL IO

In the hint, there is a number of faults for each limit. The values in the columns are underlined (it is red if load-to-limit ratio >=90%  and it is yellow if load-to-limit ratio >= 50%). For the current implementation, the only sort by the load-to-limit ratio is available.
By default, there is a descending sort by the CPU usage column.

When sorting by a column, the lines with the load-to-limit ratio >=90% for this column will have the red background color, and lines with the load-to-limit ratio >=50% for this column will have the yellow background color.

:::tip Note
The users with unlimited resources (∞) will be at the bottom of the table. 
:::

#### Users

This page contains all users for the all server of the client and their LVE statistics for the last minute. You can select the number of users on this page and search by user’s data.

The description of this page is the same as [*The most loaded server users for the last minute*](./#the-most-loaded-server-users-for-the-last-minute) of the top 5 loaded users.


![Users tab table: sort and filters; red rows for high CPU vs limit ratios](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMUsers.webp)

User’s metrics data can be sorted by the load-to-limit ratio and by the absolute value.

The absolute value is used to analyse the load produced by unlimited users.

The value of the load-to-limit ratio is convenient to use in the analysis of how many resources the users consume and whether they need to change the limits.

The values like this ![Usage text 500.2MB / ∞ for unlimited LVE limit with current consumption](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMvalue.webp) means that the resource is unlimited and 500.2 MB is the current usage of it.

Metrics data of _Idle users_ is not used in the sorting, so such users always will be at the end of the list.  The sorting can be done for only one metric.

#### Charts for Users metrics 

:::warning Note
We store the metrics data for one month only.
:::

On the user details page, the admin can find the charts for all LVE limits.

![Grid of user LVE charts: CPU, memory, IO, MySQL usage vs limits and faults](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMUsersCharts.webp)


### Alert Manager

Alert Manager allows you to create a server or user alert for selected metrics and email the triggered events.

#### Alert Manager page

![Alert Manager table: names, metrics, server/user counts, thresholds, email, type](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager1.webp)

The Alert Manager page contains a table with the following:

* **Alert name** - a unique alert name
* **Tracking metric** - a name of a server/user metric which will trigger the alert notification
* **# of servers** - number of servers on which the metric will be tracked
  * click ![Gray eye icon to expand server hostnames for an alert rule](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager2.webp) to view a list of servers host names
* **# of users** - number of users for which the metric will be tracked
  * click ![Gray eye icon to expand usernames covered by an alert rule](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager2.webp) to view a list of users names
* **Value** - a condition for the alert rule which will be applied to the tracking metrics
* **Email** - email to send the triggered events notifications
* **Type** - a type of the alert rule
* **# of triggered events** - the number of events from the time, when alert rule was created
  * ![Orange warning triangle for alert rows still firing](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager3.webp) the event is still firing
* **Time  of the last trigger** - the time of last triggered event, it is the time in your browser time zone
* **Actions** - click ![Gray pencil edit icon in alert Actions](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager4.webp) to edit and ![Gray trash delete icon in alert Actions](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager5.webp) to delete the alert rule

**Color Codes**

* **Red** color means that the event with the condition "more than" is still firing.
* **Green** color means that the event with the condition "less than" is still firing.

#### Creating an alert

To create a new alert, click the _Create alert_ button.

![Orange CREATE ALERT button with plus icon](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager7.webp)

Next, fill out the opened popup.

![Create alert modal: Server type, Apache connections metric, threshold errors, notify email](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager6.webp)

* **Name of alert** - a unique alert name
* **Alert type** - an admin can create a **user** or a **server** alert. [What is the difference between them?](./#difference-between-the-server-alert-and-the-user-alert)
* **Select user/server** - admin will see such dropdown depending on a [case of alert creating](./#cases-of-alert-creating)
* **Notify me** - the condition of the alert trigger
* **Duration** - how much time the condition should be actual to trigger the notification
* **Notify me on email** - the email to send notifications

#### Editing an alert

An admin can edit any field in the Alert except the Alert type.

#### Difference between the server alert and the user alert

The **server alert** is used to track the state of the  whole server, it does not track user state on the server.
The **server alert** tracks the next list of metrics:

1. Context switches
2. System load (1m)
3. System load (5m)
4. System load (15m)
5. CPU Basic (total)
6. CPU Basic (system)
7. CPU Basic (user)
8. CPU Basic (iowait)
9. CPU Basic (steal)
10. Network Traffic Basic (`eht0_receive`)
11. Network Traffic Basic (`eht0_transmit`)
12. Network Traffic Basic (`ehtN_receive`)
13. Network Traffic Basic (`ehtN_transmit`)
14. Disk Space Used Basic (`mountpoint: <0>`)
15. Disk Space Used Basic (`mountpoint: <1>`)
16. Disk Space Used Basic (`mountpoint: <N>`)
17. Memory Basic (available)
18. Memory Basic (used)
19. Time spent Doing I/Os
20. Disk IOps Writes Completed
21. Disk IOps Reads Completed
22. Disk Read Data
23. Disk Write Data
24. Disk Read Time
25. Disk Write Time
26. Apache connections
27. Number of requests per minute
28. MySQL queries
29. Hardware Temperature (`chip<0>`)
30. Hardware Temperature (`sensor<0>`)
31. Hardware Temperature (`chip<N>`)
32. Hardware Temperature (`sensor<N>`)
33. Open File Description

During creating a server alert an admin should select the type of metrics as the first step. The list of servers will be collected according to the availability of these metrics on the server.

For example, for now, we do not collect Apache metrics for non-cPanel servers, so you will get only cPanel servers as a list of servers for these metrics.

We're planning to implement support for other panels/web servers in the next releases.

:::tip Small limitation
We collect the server list according to having their statistics in our database (this behavior will be changed in the next releases).
:::

For example, if server state is N/A or idle more than 24 hours, it will not be visible in the list for the alert.

The **user alert** tracks the next list of LVE metrics:

1. CPU Usage (current usage)
2. CPU Usage (faults)
3. Entry Processes (current usage)
4. Entry Processes (faults)
5. Physical Memory Usage (current usage)
6. Physical Memory Usage (faults)
7. IOPS (current usage)
8. IOPS (faults)
9. IO Usage (current usage)
10. IO Usage (faults)
11. Number of Processes (current usage)
12. Number of Processes (faults)
13. MySQL CPU (current usage)
14. MySQL CPU (faults)
15. MySQL IO (current usage)

:::tip Small limitation
We collect the server list according to having their statistics in our database (this behavior will be changed in the next releases).
:::

For example, if the user state is N/A or idle more than 24 hours, it will not be visible in the list for the alert.

#### Cases of alert creating

* Creating a server alert for the selected metrics for one server
* Creating a server alert for the selected metrics for all servers (the default value)
  
In this two cases, you will not see the dropdown for selecting users because the metrics will track the server state. 

* Creating a user alert for one user, so admin can select a server and a user.
* Creating a user alert for all users on several servers/all servers (in this case admin can't select users - all users will be selected automatically)

#### What is the Firing state of the alert?

This is the state of an alert that has been active for longer than the configured threshold duration.


#### Alert notifications

![Email Alert report table: alert name, time, metric, firing target hostname](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/centralized-monitoring/CMAlertManager8.webp)

* **Alert name** - the link to the alert page
* **Firing target** - the link to the server details page



### FAQ

Limit and current load are drawing regarding the left vertical axis, the count of faults is drawing regarding the right vertical axis. You can focus on a particular line by clicking a required legend.


### Troubleshooting

#### I can't see a server statistics

1. Check that your server is registered by key or by IP license of the CloudLinux+ account, i.e., it should be seen in the list of servers in your CLN account here: [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/auth/login](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/auth/login)
2. Check that the following required packages are installed on the end server:
* <span class="notranslate">`cl-end-server-tools`</span> >= 1.0.7-1
* <span class="notranslate">`cl-node-exporter`</span> >= 1.1.0-2
* <span class="notranslate">`rhn-client-tools`</span>
    * CloudLinux OS 6 >= 1.1.15-3.el6.cloudlinux.26
    * CloudLinux OS 7 >= 2.0.2-31.el7.clouldinux
    * CloudLinux OS 8 >= 2.8.16-14.module_el8.1.0+6074+9dc6073e.cloudlinux.2
* <span class="notranslate">`lve-stats`</span> >= 3.0.7-2
* <span class="notranslate">`lve-utils`</span> >= 4.2.21-2
* <span class="notranslate">`alt-python27-cllib`</span> >= 2.1.13-1
* `lvemanager` >= 6.2.10-1
3. Check that service collecting and sending statistics is running:

<div class="notranslate">

```
service cl_plus_sender status
```
</div>

4. Check that log of the <span class="notranslate">_cl_plus_sender_</span> service doesn't contain errors:
   
<div class="notranslate">

```
/var/log/clplus_sender.log
```
</div>

#### Where can I view the events log on the client's server?

You can view the events log on the client's server here: 

<div class="notranslate">

```
/var/log/clplus_sender.log
```
</div>

#### Can I get monitoring metrics from LiteSpeed, Nginx or other (Not Apache) web server?

Starting from end-server-tools-1.0.7, it supports collecting and sending statistics from the Apache and LiteSpeed web servers.

LiteSpeed is supported on cPanel and DirectAdmin control panels.

Each minute the statistics collection daemon checks which web server is started. If LiteSpeed is started, the daemon will collect data from it, otherwise, it checks if Apache is started.

When the daemon detects that the server is changed, it writes the following line into the statistics collection daemon log `/var/log/clplus_sender.log`:

```
2020-10-09 17:25:31,462: (CL+_sender_daemon) [INFO] Apache/Litespeed collector: Using Apache
```
or

```
2020-10-09 18:13:03,897: (CL+_sender_daemon) [INFO] Apache/Litespeed collector: Using Litespeed
```

If the daemon can't detect either Apache or LiteSpeed, it writes to the log the following:

```
2020-10-09 17:33:38,399: (CL+_sender_daemon) [INFO] Apache/Litespeed collector: Apache or Litespeed stopped or absent, collector will not work
```

The statistics collection daemon reacts to the server changing automatically, no need to restart it.

:::warning Warning
Please note that the daemon checks the server type once in a minute, so the data sent on a minute of switching can be unreliable.
:::

#### Logging data sent to pushgateway to the statistics collection daemon log

Starting from `cl-end-server-tools` v.1.0.6-1, the statistics collection daemon allows to log data sent to pushgateway to its log `/var/log/clplus_sender.log`.

To start logging, run the following command: 

```
touch /var/lve/cmt_debug_logging
```

To stop logging, run the following command: 

```
rm -f /var/lve/cmt_debug_logging
```

You don't need to restart the daemon after starting/stopping logging. The presence of a control file is evaluated "on the fly".

:::warning Warning
Use this logging with caution because when it is enabled, the size of the daemon log `/var/log/clplus_sender.log` will increase each minute minimum on 3-4 KB. The actual increase size depends on the number of active users' processes on a server.
:::

### Known issues

* MySQL Governor statistics in some cases is collected incorrectly
* Sorting by MySQL Governor statistics ignores idle users
* Sorting from the search result set does not work
* Sorting by ratio for unlimited users works incorrectly

## X-Ray

### Description

:::warning Warning!
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is available out of the box for cPanel, Plesk, and DirectAdmin. For other control panels you should implement integration as described [here](/control_panel_integration/#how-to-integrate-x-ray-with-a-control-panel)
:::

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is a tool developed for website performance monitoring and performance issues detection.

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> can gather and visualize information about top N slowest system functions, external requests, software modules and database queries of the client’s website.

### Known limitations
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is not compatible with Opcache JIT optimization.
Once <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> tracing task is running for the site the Opcache JIT optimization will be disabled until tracing task completed.

![X-Ray header: Search for URL, Refresh, and green Start tracing button](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayStartTracing.webp)

### X-Ray serverwide mode

With X-Ray v0.6-11 we introduced global X-Ray mode which enables tracing extension for all PHP versions on the servers. This
mode allows your customers to [override PHP versions](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004537805-Different-PHP-versions-per-directories-using-mod-lsapi) 
in different folders and trace websites located in those folders.

In order to enable this mode, type the following command:
```
cloudlinux-xray-manager enable-serverwide-mode
```

In order to get back to default:
```
cloudlinux-xray-manager disable-serverwide-mode
```

Enable and disable commands do not stop or remove tracing tasks.


### X-Ray phpinfo mode

With X-Ray v0.6-18 we introduced new X-Ray mode which gathers website php version using information from phpinfo. This
mode allows your customers to [override PHP versions](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004537805-Different-PHP-versions-per-directories-using-mod-lsapi)

:::warning
In order to use this mode, websites should be reachable through http or https.
:::

In order to enable this mode, type the following command:
```
touch /opt/cloudlinux/flags/enabled-flags.d/xray-per-domain-php-version-mode.flag
```

In order to get back to default:
```
rm -f /opt/cloudlinux/flags/enabled-flags.d/xray-per-domain-php-version-mode.flag
```

### How to manage X-Ray

X-Ray provides several options for monitoring domain requests speed: Manual Tracing task, X-Ray Autotracing and Continuous tracing.

* **Manual Tracing task** is a task that you can create for a specific URL to collect server requests. The task will end either after a specified number of requests to the URL or after a specified time (maximum after two days). It is not possible here to automatically email a report but it is possible to export the report in PDF and send to a user.

* **Autotracing task** is a task that will be created automatically at the end of each day for slow URLs that were found during that day by the [PHP Slow Site Analyzer](/lve_manager/#website-monitoring-tool-and-slow-site-analyzer) (SSA).
Need to be enabled separately, see [How to enable X-Ray Autotracing](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#how-to-enable-x-ray-autotracing).

* **Continuous tracing** is a task that initiates daily hourly tracing requests for a specified domain and email a monitoring report. Continuous task can't stop automatically, you need to stop it manually. In fact, continuous task allows to automatically create a tracing task for each new day, with the ability to get a report for the past day.

#### Tracing tasks tab

The *Tracing tasks* tab contains a list of all tracing tasks created both manually and automatically via continuous tasks.

![Tracing tasks table: Completed rows, Created by column, view/delete, Start tracing](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayTracingTaskCreated.webp)

The *Created* column shows how a task was created – automatically (by continuous task) or manually.

#### Continuous tracing tab

:::warning Warning
To use Continuous task, update your LVE Manager and alt-PHP-X-Ray packages to versions lvemanager-6.2.9-1 and alt-php-xray-0.2-1 by running the following command:
```
yum update lvemanager alt-php-xray
```
::: 

The *Continuous tracing* tab contains a list of continuous tasks for which tracing tasks will be created automatically for a new day for a specific domain.

![Continuous tracing tab: Running status, domain, report email, Stop and Delete icons](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayContinuousTasksList.webp)

### Managing tracing task

#### Creating a new tracing task

1. Go to the <span class="notranslate">_X-Ray_</span> tab
2. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Start tracing_</span> button to create a new task
3. In the opened popup specify a website URL to trace
4. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Run_</span> button
5. Tracing will run in the default mode. In the default mode <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> traces the first 20 requests for a specified URL

![Start tracing dialog: URL error, Record for Request 20, Cancel and Run](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayTracingTask.webp)

* <span class="notranslate">**URL**</span> should be a valid URL of the domain which exists on the current hosting server. The URL field supports wildcard matching. To learn more about wildcard matching, click _How to use special characters_.
* <span class="notranslate">**Advanced settings**</span> allow you to set an IP address and tracing options: by time or by number of queries.

    ![Start tracing dialog: Advanced on, URL and time period validation errors, Client IP *, Run](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayAdvanced.webp)

**Advanced settings**

* <span class="notranslate">**Client’s IP**</span>: it is an IPv4 address of a machine to trace. For example, if you have a production website that processes requests from different IP addresses and you do not want to add these requests to the tracing task. So, you can set a specific IP address and <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will analyze requests only from this specific IP address.
Record for
* <span class="notranslate">**Time period**</span>: how much time <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> collect the requests (2 days max)
* <span class="notranslate">**Requests**</span>: the amount of requests that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will collect

After creating, the task appears in the list of tracing tasks.

![Tracing tasks compact table: Running with times left, view and stop actions](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayTrcingTaskList.webp)

#### Viewing tracing tasks list

![Tracing tasks table: filters, statuses Running Completed On Hold, pagination](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayTrcingTaskList1.webp)

Tasks created *Manually* are simply tracing tasks.

#### Tracing status

A tracing task can have the following statuses:

* <span class="notranslate">**Running**</span> – tracing is in progress
* <span class="notranslate">**Stopped**</span> – tracing was stopped by administrator
* <span class="notranslate">**On hold**</span> – the same URL already exists in the lists. Task processing will not start automatically. Administrator should start it manually.
* <span class="notranslate">**Completed**</span> – period of time is finished or number of requests is reached.

#### Collected requests for tracing task

### X-Ray Autotracing

X-Ray Autotracing automatically creates tracing tasks for slow URLs that were found during a day by the [PHP Slow Site Analyzer](/lve_manager/#website-monitoring-tool-and-slow-site-analyzer) (SSA).

:::warning Warning
To use X-Ray Autotracing, update your alt-php-ssa and alt-php-xray packages to versions alt-php-ssa-0.2-1 and alt-php-xray-0.4-1 or higher by running the following command:
```
yum update alt-php-ssa alt-php-xray --enablerepo=cloudlinux-updates-testing
```
:::

#### How to enable X-Ray Autotracing

To enable X-Ray Autotracing, run the following commands via SSH:

```
/usr/sbin/cloudlinux-ssa-manager enable-ssa
/usr/sbin/cloudlinux-autotracing enable --all
```

Check [CLI documentation](/command-line_tools/#x-ray-autotracing) for a description of the `/usr/sbin/cloudlinux-autotracing` CLI utility.

#### Requirements

* CloudLinux OS Shared Pro or CloudLinux OS Solo or CloudLinux OS Admin
* alt-php-ssa > 0.2-1 version
* alt-php-xray > 0.4-1 version
* Enabled PHP SSA on the server

#### Autotracing Interface

A new tab for Autotracing tasks was added to the X-Ray UI:


![Autotracing tasks tab: Running trace Created Automatically (Autotracing)](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayAutotracingtaskstab.webp)


#### Autotracing FAQ

Q: Why are the slow URLs in the Slow Site Analyzer report different from those on which the autotracing tasks were created?

A: Because the autotracing decision module uses rules and thresholds different from Slow Site Analyzer, which are configured by the CloudLinux team.

Q: How often autotracing tasks will be generated?

A: Once a day at the same time as a Slow Site Analyzer report.

### X-Ray Smart Advice

Smart advice is a new feature of X-Ray that is designed to find and propose solutions to fix performance issues and speed up the performance of a sites.

:::tip Note
Smart Advice will work only for CloudLinux OS Shared Pro servers with cPanel Control Panel for now.

At the moment, Smart Advise is focused only on WordPress sites.
:::

:::warning Warning
To use X-Ray Smart Advice, update your alt-php-ssa and alt-php-xray packages to versions alt-php-ssa-0.2-3 and alt-php-xray-0.5-1 or higher by running the following command:
```
yum update alt-php-ssa alt-php-xray lve-utils lvemanager --enablerepo=cloudlinux-updates-testing
```
:::

#### How to enable X-Ray Smart Advice

:::warning Attention!
If you'd like to try Smart Advice and AccelerateWP you should participate in the Beta tester program. To become a beta tester, please send your request at our Beta program page with the signup form [here](https://www.cloudlinux.com/wp-performance/). Once you submit the request, we will send you a confirmation email with program details and terms of use.
:::

#### Requirements

* CloudLinux OS Shared Pro or CloudLinux OS Solo
* alt-php-xray > 0.5-1 version
* lve-utils > 6.3.2-1 version
* lvemanager > 7.6.1-1 version
* cloudlinux-site-optimization-module > 0.1-1 version

We Recommend:

* Enable [X-Ray Autotracing](cloudlinux-os-plus/#x-ray-autotracing) on the server
* Use alt-php-ssa > 0.2-3 version

#### How X-Ray Smart Advice works

The main process of looking for advice is X-Ray tracing tasks. The best way for doing this is to enable X-Ray Autotracing. 
This will allow you to most effectively find Smart Advice for sites that have performance issues without your manual participation. 
You can find information on how to enable X-Ray Autotracing [here](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#how-to-enable-x-ray-autotracing).
On the other hand, you can create tracing tasks manually or use continuous X-Ray but we suggest you use X-Ray Autotracing for this purpose.

:::tip Note
Advice will not be generated by old tracing tasks.
:::

While the tracing task is running, X-Ray will look for places where advice can be applied. New advice will be displayed on the *Smart Advice* tab. 

![Smart Advice: suggestion counts and table with Review Applied Outdated badges](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRaySmartAdviceMainTab.webp)

After the X-Ray finds advice you will see new advice in the *Review* status on the *Smart Advice* tab. 
Then you may use the *Details* button to see which URLs were found by X-Ray that will be speed up by that advice and use *Quick Action* to enable advice for a site.

Example of details:

![Advice dialog Review: Turn on Object Cache module with URL and Turn on caching](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRaySmartAdviceDetails.webp)

After you apply the advice by using *Quick Action*, the status will change to the *Applied*.

If a long time has passed since the last time the advice was updated for a site, it will be moved to the *Outdated* status. 

:::tip Note
New X-Ray task may update *Outdated* advice if X-Ray finds performance issues that may be fixed by that advice. Then the status of advice becomes *Review*.
:::

If the process of applying advice fails you will see an error log with a detailed error, you may try to fix it manually and try again or [contact our support team for help](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us). 

Example when an error appears during advice applying:

![Smart Advice table: Quick action Error log and Try again on Review row](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRaySmartAdviceError.webp)

#### Smart Advice FAQ

Q: Why I can't see new advice on the *Smart Advice* tab?

A: For the generating of advice, it is necessary to run X-Ray tracing tasks, the best way to do it without manual interaction is to use X-Ray Autoracing. You can find more information on how to enable X-Ray Autotracing [here](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#how-to-enable-x-ray-autotracing).

#### Smart Advice CLI commands

CLI commands for managing feature advices

- `cl-smart-advice` - for managing advices;

Starting from `alt-php-xray-0.5-25` Smart Advice CLI utilities provide CLI versioning which is defined via `--api-version` option. 

:::tip Note
It is highly recommended to specify CLI version explicitly via --api-version, otherwise CLI will rely on default settings, 
which cannot guarantee backward compatability.
:::

```
cl-smart-advice --api-version <api_version> <command>
```

supported commands for `--api-version=1`:

- `list` - shows list of all advices;
- `apply` - applies specific advice;
- `rollback` - rollbacks specific advice;

##### Advices list

`--api-version=1`

```
cl-smart-advice --api-version=<api_version> list
```

For each advice in the list the CLI command returns the following information:
* `metadata`, which includes information about `username`, `domain` and `website` for which the advice is issued
* `advice` information:
  * its identifier `id` (id, that should be used in apply and rollback commands)
  * its `type` (optimization feature identifier)
  * its `status` - current status: `review` or `applied`
  * `module_name` - name of optimization feature
  * `is_premium` - if advice is for optimization feature from AccelerateWP Premium suite
  * `subscription` - info about optimization suite subscription (only if advice requires subscription)
  * `description` and `detailed_description` - human-readable descriptions of advice
  * other internal informational fields
* `result` - result of command: it may have `success` or error details

Successful output example of  `cl-smart-advice --api-version=1 list`:

### Advanced performance analytics

By enabling this feature, X-Ray will add JavaScript profiling code to each WordPress site during the tracing process. This will allow X-Ray to provide highly detailed insights into each website’s performance (greatly enhancing the quality and accuracy of SmartAdvice). The performance metrics that will be collected include TTFB (Time To First Byte), Total Blocking Time, First Contentful Paint, and more. The profiling code does not collect any user or visitor data nor sensitive data of any kind. The sole purpose of this profiling code is to gather performance-related metrics to better optimize the website.

#### How to enable/disable via UI

You can manage the setting in several interfaces:  

**X-Ray settings:**

![WHM PHP X-Ray Settings: Advanced performance analytics checked; arrow from tab](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayAdvancedMetrics.ui.xray.webp)

**AccelerateWP settings:**  

![AccelerateWP YOUR PRODUCT OPTIONS: Advanced performance analytics only checked](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayAdvancedMetrics.ui.awp.webp)

#### How to enable/disable via CLI

```
cloudlinux-xray-manager advanced-metrics --enable
```  

```
cloudlinux-xray-manager advanced-metrics --disable
```

#### How it works

To start advanced performance monitoring, you can enable tracing tasks that involve adding a JavaScript snippet to the bottom of your WordPress page. This snippet facilitates performance monitoring and allows X-Ray to gather valuable insights.

Once tracing tasks are enabled, the JavaScript snippet will periodically send POST requests to our secure analytics service.

![DevTools Network Headers: POST web-vitals 200 OK to xray.cloudlinux.com](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayAdvancedMetrics.request.webp)

These requests capture anonymous data about page load time and resources.

![DevTools Payload: JSON web-vitals FCP and TTFB poor ratings](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayAdvancedMetrics.data.webp)


### End-user X-Ray plugin

:::warning Warning
To use the end-user X-Ray plugin, update your LVE Manager and X-Ray packages to the `lvemanager-6.3.9-1` (or later) and `alt-php-xray-0.3-1` (or later) by running the following command:
```
yum update lvemanager alt-php-xray
```
:::

#### How to enable/disable the end-user X-Ray plugin

You can hide or show the end-user X-Ray plugin icon by ticking or unticking the proper checkbox in the LVE Manager.

Go to _LVE Manager → Options Tab → User interface settings_.

![User interface settings: Hide X-Ray App unchecked; red arrow on checkbox](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/HideXRayAppCheckbox.webp)

:::tip Note
The X-Ray plugin icon in the end-user interface is hidden when the checkbox is ticked.
:::

![cPanel SOFTWARE section: X-Ray App tile with red arrow](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayAppUIIcon.webp)

#### How to manage the end-user X-Ray plugin

The web interface of the end-user X-Ray plugin is almost the same as the X-Ray administrator interface.

![End-user PHP X-Ray Tracing tasks: Running row, Created, Start tracing button](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayEndUserUI.webp)

But there are some differences and they are described further.

* End-users can create tasks only for their domains from the drop-down list:
    ![Start tracing: Choose domain dropdown open; mask field error Please specify mask](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayEndUserUIStart.webp)
* To specify URL or wildcard, end-users should use the input field next to the domain:
    ![Start tracing: domain user1.com and wordpress/* mask highlighted; Run](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayEndUserUiSpecifyURL.webp)

You can read about all other basic interface elements and managing tracing tasks in the [Managing tracing task section](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#managing-tracing-task).

:::tip Note
Tracing tasks created by an end-user will also be displayed in the administrator interface and administrators can manage the end-user's tasks the same way as they manage their own. At the same time, tasks created by the administrator or other end-users will not be displayed in the UI of the current user.
:::

#### End-user X-Ray plugin limitations

* The end-user X-Ray plugin does not support creating continuous tasks.
* The end-user has a limit of tracing tasks running at a time. Before starting the next task, the end-user should wait for the completion of the previous ones or forcefully stop the running ones. Otherwise, the user will get the next error:
    
    ![Red error banner: limit of running tasks is one already reached](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayEndUserUIError.webp)
    :::tip Note
    The current limit is one tracing task per user. 
    :::
* The administrator and the end-user can’t run the tracing task for the same Domain/URL at the same time. Once, the administrator started a specific tracing task, the end-user will not be able to duplicate it. And the same is true for the administrators – they will just see the running task for the specific domain and see the notification that they're trying to create a tracing task with a duplicated URL.
* If continuous tracing is enabled for the domain, the end-user will not be able to create a new task for this domain because the same rule works - it will be a duplicate of the existing tracing tasks. The next warning will appear:
    
    ![Orange warning banner: Task duplicated by URL with Show less link](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayEndUserUIWarning.webp)

    To solve this, the existing running tasks for the same Domain/URL should be stopped or completed. You can find more details about this in the [FAQ](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#what-should-i-do-if-i-see-the-warning-task-is-duplicated-by-url).

* If a user's tracing task was created for a domain which is using the FPM handler there's an additional limitation.  To avoid  frequent reloads of the particular FPM service, **Start tracing** ,  **Stop tracing** or  **Continue tracing** action would be blocked in case if the latest reload of a corresponding FPM service was done less than 1 minute ago.  
If a user gets such an error message - it means that  1 reload  in  1 minute for a particular FPM service has been already done.  Just try performing the same operation once again in a while.

![Red error: X-Ray User service busy; try again in one minute](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayEndUserFPMerror.webp)
    
### X-Ray automated throttling detection

:::tip Note
**CPU throttling detection** is available since `alt-php-xray-0.3-2` and `lvemanager-xray-0.5-2`.

**IO/IOPS throttling detection** is available since `alt-php-xray-0.3-7` and `lvemanager-xray-0.7-1`.

- `kmod-lve-2.0-23` (and later) for CloudLinux OS 8 or CloudLinux OS 7 hybrid
- `kernel-1.5-58` (and later) for CloudLinux OS 7 or CloudLinux OS 6 hybrid

are also required to utilize the feature of **IO/IOPS throttling detection**.
:::

:::warning Warning
X-Ray automated throttling detection feature is not supported for CloudLinux OS 6
:::

The X-Ray automated throttling detection system checks if the account exceeds LVE limits by CPU or by IO/IOPS during the HTTP request execution. Requests with exceeded LVE limits are indicated in both X-Ray Administrator and X-Ray User plugins.

If CPU limiting was detected for a particular request, it is indicated in the X-Ray UI that the system itself has slowed down the request processing due to CPU throttling and this is apparently not a performance issue in the PHP code.

If limiting by IO and IOPS in total was detected for a particular request, it is indicated in the X-Ray UI in the same manner, except for the cause of slowing down the request -- IO throttling.

The case of both limiting for the request is also possible.

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are also marked in the request detailed view.

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are marked in the PDF report as well.

### X-Ray client

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> client is a PHP extension named <span class="notranslate">`xray.so`</span>. It analyzes the processing time of the entire request and its parts and then sends the data to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent.

### X-Ray agent 


This is a service that receives data from the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> client and sends it to the remote storage.

#### Managing X-Ray service

The <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent is managed by the <span class="notranslate">`service`</span> utility.

* To start the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    service xray-agent start
    ```
    </div>

* To stop the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    service xray-agent stop
    ```
    </div>

* To restart the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    service xray-agent restart
    ```
    </div>


### FAQ

#### Does X-Ray affect website performance?

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> affects website performance. Our tests show 5-10 % overhead from a website loading time with <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> tracing enabled.
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> allows you to find website performance issues and should not be enabled permanently. If your website is very slow, you can enable <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> to find the cause and then disable it.


#### My customers [override php versions](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004537805-Different-PHP-versions-per-directories-using-mod-lsapi) in different folders and X-Ray does not trace those websites, what should I do?

You should turn on the [X-Ray serverwide mode](#x-ray-serverwide-mode) or the [X-Ray phpinfo mode](#x-ray-phpinfo-mode).


#### What should I do if I see the warning "Task is duplicated by URL"?

This warning means that you already have a task to trace this URL in the list of your tracing tasks. If you see this warning, a new task can be created only with the <span class="notranslate">_On hold_</span> status and you will be able to run it only when the previous task with the same URL will be completed.

Note that the URL field supports wildcard matching and you can have a case when <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is tracing the <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/*`</span> and you are trying to create a new task with <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/xray.php`</span>. In this case, you will see that warning because the `*` URLs array includes <span class="notranslate">`xray.php`</span>.

#### I started a tracing task and made requests to URL but did not see any results in the UI. What should I do?

1. <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> may not send data if a site uses a caching plugin, as the caching plugin is outputting HTML, thus there are no PHP scripts to examine. We encountered such issues with sites that use <span class="notranslate">LSCache</span> and <span class="notranslate">WP Super Cache</span> plugins. Check that your site does not use caching plugins. If so, disable it while tracing a site to get information from <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span>. Moreover, it can also be because of caching on server side, for example NGINX Cache. Or when using CDN because requests are processed from another host. In such cases, during tracing, caching must also be disabled.
2. If you set a client’s IP when creating the tracing task, check that your requests come to the server with this IP via phpinfo (since there may be NAT between your local machine and the server).
   
    ![phpinfo row: $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] value 10.106.1.145](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayPHPInfoRemoteAddr.webp)

3. Check that <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension is enabled for the domain. To do so, go to the <span class="notranslate">`phpinfo()`</span> page and make a request. In the phpinfo output try to find the following section:
   
    ![phpinfo xray directives table: xray.enabled On and related values](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayPHPInfo.webp)

If you cannot see that section, try to restart PHP processes for that user (the simplest way is to restart Apache) and check that you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension.

4. If you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension in the phpinfo, check that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent service is running with the service xray-agent status command. If it is not running, start it with the <span class="notranslate">`service xray-agent start`</span> command.

5. If, after checking the previous items, the issue persists, [contact our support team](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

#### What to do if X-Ray is not found in the phpinfo() page?

If you managed to create a tracing task, this means that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> file was created in a system. Therefore, there may be two reasons why it did not appear in the phpinfo page of the domain.

1. PHP process wasn't reloaded after adding the xray.ini. To solve this, you should restart the Apache or fpm service for the domain on which the tracing was started. At the moment, this is done automatically by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager after creating the task.
2. Your domain uses a PHP version different from the one which was detected by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager. To solve this, check the scan dir for additional ini files for your domain.

    ![phpinfo row: Scan this dir for additional .ini files /opt/alt/php70/link/conf](/images/cloudlinuxos/shared-pro/x-ray/XRayScanDir.webp)

    Then check the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> that was passed to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager by running the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    cat /usr/share/alt-php-xray/manager.log | grep ini_location
    ```
    </div>

    Find your tracing task in the output and check that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> exists in this directory, also check that the `ini` path is the same in the phpinfo page output and in the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> directive for your tracing task. If they are the same, you should reload your PHP. If they are different that means that the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager could not correctly determine the PHP version your domain uses. In this case, contact our support team at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new).


#### I use LiteSpeed, X-Ray is enabled and it is shown in the phpinfo() page but does not collect data when sending requests to a site. What to do?

Check for the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option in the `htaccess` file for your domain.
If the option is there, LiteSpeed processes requests bypassing the PHP X-Ray extension.
In this case, to get tracing information, you should remove the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option.

#### What is the proper format for the URL?

All of the examples below are correct:

* `http://domain.com`
* `http://domain.com/`
* `https://domain.com`
* `https://domain.com/`

You can use any of them with a prefix `www.` and it is also correct.

#### What packages are required for X-Ray?

Required packages:

* `lvemanager` >= 6.2.10-1
* `alt-php-xray` >= 0.2-1

## Link server to CLN account (available only for resellers and activated by demand)

**Why do we need a server linking to CLN?**  
One of the main CloudlinuxOS Shared Pro features is Centralized Monitoring. In case when a customer uses the license provided by the reseller the server registered with such license will be linked to the reseller's CLN account. As a result, customers cannot see the data in Centralized Monitoring. To allow a customer to see the data in such a case we implemented an ability to link the server to the customer's own CLN account.

**Who can use it?**  
Only customers who use CloudlinuxOS Shared Pro licenses provided by resellers can use this feature.
However, it's crucial to understand when linking is appropriate.

The primary users for this feature are customers of license-only resellers. If you acquired your license this way, you can link the server to your CLN account. By doing so, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to only link servers that belong to the same owner.

:::warning Сonditions under which linking is not advisable!
Some partners use a single account to manage servers they own directly alongside servers they resell to various clients. To avoid mixing data and granting unintended access, these distinct groups of servers should not be linked to one end-customer account.
:::

:::tip Info
If you are a reseller and interested in this feature, please leave your request on [our feature portal](https://features.cloudlinux.com/).
:::

**How to link a server?** 
If your server is linkable you will see in the Cloudlinux Manager UI (Dashboard tab) the component with input field which allows linking the server to CLN.

![WHM CloudLinux Manager Dashboard: Link server to CLN token field and button](/images/cm-ui-component.webp)

To link the server, it is required to perform the following:

1. Create a CLN account if you do not have one [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/register/customer](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/register/customer).
2. Log into your CLN account and copy the linking token. If you click the “Get the token” button you will be redirected to [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/profile/details](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/profile/details) where can copy the token
3. Paste the token into the “Enter token” input and click the “Link server” button

After these steps you server will be linked. And you will see it in the Centralized Monitoring.

### CLI utility /usr/sbin/cl-link-to-cln 

We can also bind a server from the command line. To do this can be used `/usr/sbin/cl-link-to-cln` utility.

```
/usr/sbin/cl-link-to-cln --help  
Usage: cl-link-to-cln [options]
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TOKEN, --linking-token=TOKEN
                        Token to link the server
  -s, --linking-status  Show if status linked or not
```

To link we have to:

1. Check if the server can be linked:
```
/usr/sbin/cl-link-to-cln --linking-status  
{
    "result": "success",
    "timestamp": 1698670480.3382068,
    "linked": false,
    "linkable": true
}
```

* **linked (boolean)** field define if server is already linked
* **linkable (boolean)** field define if server can be linked

2. Link the server with the command:
```
/usr/sbin/cl-link-to-cln --linking-token=TOKEN
```

Token you can find here [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/profile/details](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/profile/details).
